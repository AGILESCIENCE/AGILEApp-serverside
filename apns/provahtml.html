<b>Gamma-ray observations of Cygnus X-1 above 100 MeV in the hard and soft states
</b><br>
(2013) Astrophysical Journal, 766 (2), art. no. 83, . 
<br>
ABSTRACT: We present the results of multi-year gamma-ray observations by the AGILE satellite of the black hole binary system Cygnus X-1. In a previous investigation we focused on gamma-ray observations of Cygnus X-1 in the hard state during the period mid-2007/2009. Here we present the results of the gamma-ray monitoring of Cygnus X-1 during the period 2010/mid-2012 which includes a remarkably prolonged "soft state" phase (2010 June-2011 May). Previous 1-10 MeV observations of Cyg X-1 in this state hinted at a possible existence of a non-thermal particle component with substantial modifications of the Comptonized emission from the inner accretion disk. Our AGILE data, averaged over the mid-2010/mid-2011 soft state of Cygnus X-1, provide a significant upper limit for gamma-ray emission above 100 MeV of F soft &lt; 20 × 10-8 photons cm-2 s -1 , excluding the existence of prominent non-thermal emission above 100 MeV during the soft state of Cygnus X-1. We discuss theoretical implications of our findings in the context of high-energy emission models of black hole accretion. We also discuss possible gamma-ray flares detected by AGILE. In addition to a previously reported episode observed by AGILE in 2009 October during the hard state, we report a weak but important candidate for enhanced emission which occurred at the end of 2010 June (2010 June 30 10:00-2010 July 2 10:00 UT) exactly coinciding with a hard-to-soft state transition and before an anomalous radio flare. An appendix summarizes all previous high-energy observations and possible detections of Cygnus X-1 above 1 MeV. (C) 2013. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.

<b>Variable gamma-ray emission from the crab nebula: Short flares and long "waves"
</b><br>
(2013) Astrophysical Journal, 765 (1), art. no. 52, . 
<br>
ABSTRACT: Gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula has been recently shown to be unsteady. In this paper, we study the flux and spectral variability of the Crab above 100 MeV on different timescales ranging from days to weeks. In addition to the four main intense and day-long flares detected by AGILE and Fermi-LAT between 2007 September and 2012 September, we find evidence for week-long and less intense episodes of enhanced gamma-ray emission that we call "waves." Statistically significant "waves" show timescales of 1-2 weeks, and can occur by themselves or in association with shorter flares. We present a refined flux and spectral analysis of the 2007 September-October gamma-ray enhancement episode detected by AGILE that shows both "wave" and flaring behavior. We extend our analysis to the publicly available Fermi-LAT data set and show that several additional "wave" episodes can be identified. We discuss the spectral properties of the 2007 September "wave"/flare event and show that the physical properties of the "waves" are intermediate between steady and flaring states. Plasma instabilities inducing "waves" appear to involve spatial distances l ∼ 1016 cm and enhanced magnetic fields B ∼ (0.5-1) mG. Day-long flares are characterized by smaller distances and larger local magnetic fields. Typically, the deduced total energy associated with the "wave" phenomenon (Ew ∼ 1042 erg, where Ew is the kinetic energy of the emitting particles) is comparable with that associated to the flares, and can reach a few percent of the total available pulsar spin-down energy. Most likely, flares and waves are the product of the same class of plasma instabilities that we show acting on different timescales and radiation intensities. (C) 2013.

<b>A variability study of the AGILE first catalog of γ-ray sources on 2.3 years of AGILE pointed observations
</b><br>
(2013) Advances in Space Research, 51 (2), pp. 253-257. 
<br>
ABSTRACT: AGILE pointed observations performed from July 9, 2007 to October 30, 2009 cover a very large time interval, with a γ-ray data archive useful to perform monitoring studies of medium to high brightness γ-ray sources in the 30 MeV-50 GeV energy range. The first AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) catalog (Pittori et al.; 2009) included a significance-limited (4σ) sample of 47 sources (1AGL), detected with a conservative analysis over the first-year of operations. We present a variability study of the 1AGL sources over the complete AGILE pointed Observation Blocks (OBs) dataset. In the analysis here reported we used data obtained with an improved full Field of View (FOV) event filter, on a much larger (about 27.5 months) dataset, integrating data on the OB timescales, mostly ranging between 4 and 30 days. The data processing resulted in an improved source list as compared to the 1AGL one. We present here our results on the variability of some of these sources. (C) 2011 COSPAR.

ABSTRACT: Lightning and thunderstorm systems in general have been recently recognized as powerful particle accelerators, capable of producing electrons, positrons, gamma-rays and neutrons with energies as high as several tens of MeV. In fact, these natural systems turn out to be the highest energy and most efficient natural particle accelerators on Earth. Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) are millisecond long, very intense bursts of gamma-rays and are one of the most intriguing manifestation of these natural accelerators. Only three currently operative missions are capable of detecting TGFs from space: the RHESSI, Fermi and AGILE satellites. In this paper we review the characteristics of TGFs, including energy spectrum, timing structure, beam geometry and correlation with lightning, and the basic principles of the associated production models. Then we focus on the recent AGILE discoveries concerning the high energy extension of the TGF spectrum up to 100 MeV, which is difficult to reconcile with current theoretical models.

<b>On-ground calibration of AGILE-GRID with a photon beam: Results and lessons for the future

ABSTRACT: At the core of the AGILE scientific instrument, designed to operate on a satellite, there is the Gamma Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) consisting of a Silicon Tracker (ST), a Cesium Iodide Mini-Calorimeter and an Anti- Coincidence system of plastic scintillator bars. The ST needs an on-ground calibration with a γ-ray beam to validate the simulation used to calculate the energy response function and the effective area versus the energy and the direction of the ? rays. A tagged γ-ray beam line was designed at the Beam Test Facility (BTF) of the INFN Laboratori Nazionali of Frascati (LNF), based on an electron beam generating γ rays through bremsstrahlung in a position-sensitive target. The γ-ray energy is deduced by the difference with the post-bremsstrahlung electron energy1-.2 The electron energy is measured by a spectrometer consisting of a dipole magnet and an array of position sensitive silicon strip detectors, the Photon Tagging System (PTS). The use of the combined BTF-PTS system as tagged photon beam requires understanding the efficiency of γ-ray tagging, the probability of fake tagging, the energy resolution and the relation of the PTS hit position versus the γ-ray energy. This paper describes this study comparing data taken during the AGILE calibration occurred in 2005 with simulation. (C) 2012 SPIE.

<b>Calibration of AGILE-GRID with in-flight data and Monte Carlo simulations
</b><br>
(2012) Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 8443, art. no. 84434E, . 
<br>
ABSTRACT: AGILE is a γ/X-ray telescope which has been in orbit since 23 April 2007. The γ-ray detector, AGILE-GRID, has observed Galactic and extragalactic sources, many of which were collected in the first AGILE Catalog. We present the calibration of the AGILE-GRID using in-flight data and updated Monte Carlo simulations, producing response matrices for the effective area, energy dispersion,and point spread dispersion as a function of pointing direction in instrument coordinates and energy. We performed Monte Carlo simulations in GEANT3 at different ray photon energies and incident angles,using Kalman filter-based photon reconstruction and on-board and on-ground filters. Long integrations of in-flight observations of the Vela, Crab and Geminga sources in broad and narrow energy bands were used to validate and improve the instrument response matrices. The weighted average point spread functions as a function of spectra correspond well to the data for all sources and energy bands.Recent changes in both the implementation of the interpolation of point spread function Monte Carlo data and the procedure for construction of the energy-weighted effective area have improved the correspondence between predicted and observedux and spectra of celestial calibration sources, reducing false positives and obviating the need for post-hoc energy-dependent scaling factors. These changes will be re ected in the upcoming public release of the AGILE analysis software by the Agile Science Data Centre. (C) 2012 SPIE.

<b>Upper limits on the high-energy emission from gamma-ray bursts observed by AGILE-GRID
</b><br>
(2012) Astronomy and Astrophysics, 547, art. no. A95, . 
<br>
ABSTRACT: Context. The detection and the characterization of the highenergy emission component from individual gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is one of the key science objectives of the currently operating gamma-ray satellite AGILE, launched in April 2007. In its first two years of operation AGILE detected three GRBs with photons of energy larger than 30 MeV. One more GRB was detected in AGILE third operation year, while operating in spinning mode. Aims. For the 64 other GRBs localized during the period July 2007 to October 2009 in the field of view of the AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID), but not detected by this instrument, we estimate the count and flux upper limits on the GRB high energy emission in the AGILE-GRID energy band (30 MeV-3 GeV). Methods. To calculate the count upper limits, we adopted a Bayesian approach. The flux upper limits are derived using several assumptions on the high-energy spectral behavior. For 28 GRBs with available prompt spectral information, a flux upper limit and the comparison with the expected flux estimated from spectral extrapolation of the Band spectrum to the 30 MeV-3 GeV band are provided. Moreover, upper limits on the flux under the assumption of an extra power law component dominating the 30 MeV-3 GeV band are calculated for all GRBs and considering four different values for the spectral photon index. Finally, we performed a likelihood upper limit on the possible delayed emission up to 1 h after the GRB. Results. The estimated flux upper limits range between 1 × 10 -4 and ∼2 × 10 -2 photons cm -2 s -1 and generally lie above the flux estimated from the extrapolation of the prompt emission in the 30 MeV-3 GeV band. A notable case is GRB 080721, where the AGILE-GRID upper limit suggests a steeper spectral index or the presence of a cut-off in the high energy part of the Band prompt spectrum. The four GRBs detected by AGILE-GRID show high-energy (30 MeV-3 GeV) to low-energy (1 keV-10 MeV) fluence ratios similar to those estimated in this paper for the 64 GRBs without GRID detection, favoring the possibility that AGILE-GRID detected only high-fluence, hard GRBs. From the flux upper limits derived in this work we put some constraint on high-energy radiation from the afterglow emission and from synchrotron self Compton emission in internal shocks.

<b>The AGILE monitoring of Cygnus X-3: Transient gamma-ray emission and spectral constraints
</b><br>
(2012) Astronomy and Astrophysics, 545, art. no. A110, . Cited 1 time.
<br>
ABSTRACT: We present the AGILE-GRID (Astro-rivelatore Gamma a Immagini LEggero-Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector) monitoring of Cygnus X-3, during the period between November 2007 and July 2009. We report here the whole AGILE-GRID monitoring of Cygnus X-3 in the AGILE "pointing" mode data-taking, to confirm that the γ-ray activity coincides with the same repetitive pattern of multiwavelength emission and analyze in depth the overall γ-ray spectrum by assuming both leptonic and hadronic scenarios. Seven intense γ-ray events were detected in this period, with a typical event lasting one or two days. These durations are longer than the likely cooling times of the γ-ray emitting particles, implying we see continuous acceleration rather than the result of an impulsive event such as the ejection of a single plasmoid that then cools as it propagates outwards. Cross-correlating the AGILE-GRID light curve with both X-ray and radio monitoring data, we find that the main events of γ-ray activity were detected while the system was in soft spectral X-ray states (RXTE/ASM (Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer/All-Sky Monitor)count rate in the 3-5 keV band ≥ 3 counts s -1), that coincide with local and often sharp minima of the hard X-ray flux (Swift/BAT (Burst Alert Telescope) count rate ≤ 0.02 countsâ cm -2 s -1), a few days before intense radio outbursts. This repetitive temporal coincidence between the γ-ray transient emission and spectral state changes of the source turns out to be the spectral signature of γ-ray activity from this microquasar. These γ-ray events may thus reflect a sharp transition in the structure of the accretion disk and its corona, which leads to a rebirth of the microquasar jet and subsequent enhanced activity in the radio band. The γ-ray differential spectrum of Cygnus X-3 (100 MeV-3 GeV), which was obtained by averaging the data collected by the AGILE-GRID during the γ-ray events, is consistent with a power law of photon index α = 2.0±0.2. Finally, we examine leptonic and hadronic emission models for the γ-ray events and find that both scenarios are valid. In the leptonic model-based on inverse Compton scatterings of mildly relativistic electrons on soft photons from both the Wolf-Rayet companion star and the accretion disk-the emitting particles may also contribute to the overall hard X-ray spectrum, possibly explaining the hard non-thermal power-law tail seen during special soft X-ray states in Cygnus X-3.

<b>The characterization of the distant blazar GB6 J1239+0443 from flaring and low activity periods
</b><br>
(2012) Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 425 (3), pp. 2015-2026. 
<br>
ABSTRACT: In 2008, AGILE and Fermi detected gamma-ray flaring activity from the unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1236+0457, recently associated with a flat spectrum radio quasar (GB6 J1239+0443) at z = 1.762. The optical counterpart of the gamma-ray source underwent a flux enhancement of a factor of 15-30 in six years, and of ∼10 in six months. We interpret this flare-up in terms of a transition from an accretion-disc-dominated emission to a synchrotron-jet-dominated one. We analysed a Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) archival optical spectrum taken during a period of low radio and optical activity of the source. We estimated the mass of the central black hole using the width of the Civ emission line. In our work, we have also investigated SDSS archival optical photometric data and ultraviolet GALEX observations to estimate the thermal disc emission contribution of GB6 J1239+0443. Our analysis of the gamma-ray data taken during the flaring episodes indicates a flat gamma-ray spectrum, with an extension of up to 15GeV, with no statistically relevant sign of absorption from the broad-line region, suggesting that the blazar zone is located beyond the broad-line region. This result is confirmed by the modelling of the broad-band spectral energy distribution (well constrained by the available multiwavelength data) of the flaring activity periods and by the accretion disc luminosity and black hole mass estimated by us using archival data. © 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2012 RAS.

ABSTRACT: At the core of the AGILE scientific instrument, designed to operate on a satellite, there is the Gamma Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) consisting of a Silicon Tracker (ST), a Cesium Iodide Mini-Calorimeter and an Anti-Coincidence system of plastic scintillator bars. The ST needs an on-ground calibration with a γ-ray beam to validate the simulation used to calculate the energy response function and the effective area versus the energy and the direction of the γ rays. A tagged γ-ray beam line was designed at the Beam Test Facility (BTF) of the INFN Laboratori Nazionali of Frascati (LNF), based on an electron beam generating γ-rays through bremsstrahlung in a position-sensitive target. The γ-ray energy is deduced by difference with the post-bremsstrahlung electron energy [1,2]. The electron energy is measured by a spectrometer consisting of a dipole magnet and an array of position sensitive silicon strip detectors, the Photon Tagging System (PTS). The use of the combined BTF-PTS system as tagged photon beam requires understanding the efficiency of γ-ray tagging, the probability of fake tagging, the energy resolution and the relation of the PTS hit position versus the γ-ray energy. This paper describes this study comparing data taken during the AGILE calibration occurred in 2005 with simulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<b>Evaluating the maximum likelihood method for detecting short-term variability of AGILE γ-ray sources
</b><br>

ABSTRACT: Context. The AGILE space mission (whose instrument is sensitive to the energy ranges 18-60 keV, and 30 MeV-50 GeV) has been operating since 2007. Assessing the statistical significance of the time variability of γ-ray sources above 100 MeV is a primary task of the AGILE data analysis. In particular, it is important to verify the instrument sensitivity in terms of Poisson modeling of the data background, and to determine the post-trial confidence of detections. Aims. The goals of this work are: (i) to evaluate the distributions of the likelihood ratio test for both "empty" fields and regions of the Galactic plane, and (ii) to calculate the probability of false detections over multiple time intervals. Methods. We describe in detail the techniques used to search for short-term variability in the AGILE γ-ray source database. We describe the binned maximum likelihood method used for the analysis of AGILE data, and the numerical simulations that support the characterization of the statistical analysis. We apply our method to both Galactic and extragalactic transients, and provide a few examples. Results. After checking the reliability of the statistical description tested with the real AGILE data, we obtain the distribution of p-values for blind and specific source searches. We apply our results to the determination of the post-trial statistical significance of detections of transient γ-ray sources in terms of pre-trial values. Conclusions. The results of our analysis allow a precise determination of the post-trial significance of γ-ray sources detected by AGILE. (C) 2012 ESO.

<b>AGILE detection of Cygnus X-3 γ-ray active states during the period mid-2009/mid-201bulgarelli@iasfbo.inaf.it

ABSTRACT: Context.Cygnus X-3 (Cyg X-3) is a well-known microquasar producing variable emission at all wavelengths. Cyg X-3 is a prominent X-ray binary producing relativistic jets, and studying its high energy emission is crucial for the understanding of the fundamental acceleration processes in accreting compact objects. Aims. Our goal is to study extreme particle acceleration and γ-ray production above 100 MeV during special spectral states of Cyg X-3 usually characterized by a low hard X-ray flux and enhanced soft X-ray states. Methods. We observed Cyg X-3 with the AGILE satellite in extended time intervals from 2009 Jun.-Jul., and 2009 Nov.-2010 Jul. We report here the results of the AGILE γ-ray monitoring of Cyg X-3 as well as the results from extensive multiwavelength campaigns involving radio (RATAN-600, AMI-LA and Metsahovi Radio Observatories) and X-ray monitoring data (XTE and Swift). Results. We detect a series of repeated γ-ray flaring activity from Cyg X-3 that correlate with the soft X-ray states and episodes of decreasing or non-detectable hard X-ray emission. Furthermore, we detect γ-ray enhanced emission that tends to be associated with radio flares greater than 1 Jy at 15 GHz, confirming a trend already detected in previous observations. The source remained active above 100 MeV for an extended period of time (almost 1.5 months in 2009 Jun.-Jul. and 1 month in 2010 May). We study in detail the short timescale γ-ray flares that occurred before or near the radio peaks. Conclusions. Our results confirm the transient nature of the extreme particle acceleration from the microquasar Cyg X-3. A series of repeated 1 ã-ray flares shows correlations with radio and X-ray emission confirming a well established trend of emission. We compare our results with Fermi-LAT and MAGIC TeV observations of Cyg X-3. (C) 2012 ESO.

<b>Neutral pion emission from accelerated protons in the supernova remnant W44
</b><br>
(2011) Astrophysical Journal Letters, 742 (2), art. no. L30, . Cited 4 times.
<br>
ABSTRACT: We present the AGILE gamma-ray observations in the energy range 50MeV-10GeV of the supernova remnant (SNR) W44, one of the most interesting systems for studying cosmic-ray production. W44 is an intermediate-age SNR (∼20, 000 years) and its ejecta expand in a dense medium as shown by a prominent radio shell, nearby molecular clouds, and bright [SII] emitting regions. We extend our gamma-ray analysis to energies substantially lower than previous measurements which could not conclusively establish the nature of the radiation. We find that gamma-ray emission matches remarkably well both the position and shape of the inner SNR shocked plasma. Furthermore, the gamma-ray spectrum shows a prominent peak near 1GeV with a clear decrement at energies below a few hundreds of MeV as expected from neutral pion decay. Here we demonstrate that (1) hadron-dominated models are consistent with all W44 multiwavelength constraints derived from radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations; (2) ad hoc lepton-dominated models fail to explain simultaneously the well-constrained gamma-ray and radio spectra, and require a circumstellar density much larger than the value derived from observations; and (3) the hadron energy spectrum is well described by a power law (with index s = 3.0 ± 0.1) and a low-energy cut-off at E c = 6 ± 1GeV. Direct evidence for pion emission is then established in an SNR for the first time. (C) 2011. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..

<b>The AGILE observations of the hard and bright GRB 100724B

<br>
ABSTRACT: The observation of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) in the gamma ray band has been advanced by the AGILE and Fermi satellites after the era of the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory. AGILE and Fermi are showing that the GeV-bright GRBs share a set of common features, particularly the high fluence from the keV up to the GeV energy bands, the high value of the minimum Lorentz factor, an extended emission of gamma rays, which is often delayed with respect to lower energies, and finally the possible multiple spectral components. GRB 100724B, localised in a joint effort by Fermi and the InterPlanetary Newtork, is the brightest burst detected in gamma rays so far by AGILE. Characteristic features of GRB 100724B are the simultaneous emissions at MeV and GeV, without delayed onset or any time lag as shown by the analysis of the cross correlation function, and the significant spectral evolution in hard X-rays over the event duration. In this paper we show the analysis of the AGILE data of GRB 100724B and discuss its features in the context of the bursts observed so far in gamma rays and the recently proposed models. (C) 2011 ESO.

<b>The Crab Nebula super-flare in 2011 april: Extremely fast particle acceleration and gamma-ray emission
</b><br>
(2011) Astrophysical Journal Letters, 741 (1), art. no. L5, . Cited 3 times.
<br>
ABSTRACT: We report on the extremely intense and fast gamma-ray flare above 100MeV detected by AGILE from the Crab Nebula in mid-April 2011. This event is the fourth of a sequence of reported major gamma-ray flares produced by the Crab Nebula in the period 2007/mid-2011. These events are attributed to strong radiative and plasma instabilities in the inner Crab Nebula, and their properties are crucial for theoretical studies of fast and efficient particle acceleration up to 1015 eV. Here we study the very rapid flux and spectral evolution of the event that on 2011 April 16 reached the record-high peak flux of F = (26 5) × 10-6 photons cm-2 s -1 with a rise-time timescale that we determine to be in the range 6-10hr. The peak flaring gamma-ray spectrum reaches a distinct maximum near 500MeV with no substantial emission above 1 GeV. The very rapid rise time and overall evolution of the Crab Nebula flare strongly constrain the acceleration mechanisms and challenge MHD models. We briefly discuss the theoretical implications of our observations. (C) 2011. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.

<b>The observation of GRBs with AGILE and the interesting cases of GRB 090618 and GRB 100724B

<br>
ABSTRACT: The AGILE satellite, in orbit since 2007, is localizing about 0.5 GRBs per month with the hard X-ray Imager superagile (18-60 keV) and is detecting around 1 GRB per week with the non-imaging Minicalorimeter (0.35 - 100 MeV). Up to now the AGILE Gamma Ray Imaging Detector firmly detected four GRBs in the energy band between 20 MeV and few GeV. In this presentation we review the status of the GRBs observation with AGILE, we discuss the upper limits in the gamma-ray band of the non-detected events and we show some interesting bursts, especially GRB 090618 (bright in soft and hard-X rays, optical and radio but lacking GeV emission) and GRB 100724B (with a bright GeV emission simultaneous to hard-X rays without delayed onset).

<b>Multiwavelength Observations of the Gamma-ray Blazars Detected by AGILE
</b><br>
(2011) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 280 (1), art. no. 012002, . 
<br>
ABSTRACT: Since its launch in April 2007, the AGILE satellite detected with the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector several blazars in high γ-ray activity: 3C 279, 3C 454.3, PKS 1510-089, S5 0716+714, 3C 273, W Comae and Mrk 421. Thanks to the rapid dissemination of our alerts, we were able to obtain multiwavelength ToO data from other observatories such as Spitzer, Swift, RXTE, Suzaku, INTEGRAL, MAGIC, VERITAS, as well as radio-to-optical coverage by means of the GASP Project of the WEBT and the REM Telescope. This large multifrequency coverage gave us the opportunity to study truly simultaneous spectral energy distributions of these sources from radio to γ-ray energy bands and to investigate the different mechanisms responsible for their emission. We present an overview of the AGILE results on these γ-ray blazars and the relative multifrequency data. (C) Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

<b>High spatial resolution correlation of AGILE TGFs and global lightning activity above the equatorial belt
</b><br>
(2011) Geophysical Research Letters, 38 (14), art. no. L14806, . Cited 1 time.
<br>
ABSTRACT: The AGILE satellite detects Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) in the 0.35-100 MeV energy range using its Mini-Calorimeter (MCAL) instrument with an average detection rate of 10 TGFs/month. Thanks to its Low Earth Orbit with only 2.5 degree of inclination, AGILE guarantees an unprecedented exposure above the equator, where both lightning activity and TGF detection peak. Here we report the comparison between the AGILE TGFs detected between March 2009 and February 2010 and full climatology lightning worldwide distribution based on satellite optical observations from LIS (Lightning Imaging Sensor) and OTD (Optical Transient Detector) instruments. This approach is complementary to the one-to-one TGF/lightning correlations by ground-based sferics measurements. Based on mono and bi-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we show that the AGILE TGFs and time-averaged global lightning in the equatorial area are not drawn from the same distribution. However, we find significant regional differences in the degree of correlation as well as in the TGF/lightning ratio. In the case of south east Asia we find a 87% probability for the TGF and lightning being samples of the same distribution. This result supports the idea that the physical conditions at play in TGF generation can have strong geographical and climatological modulation. Based on the assumption that the observed range of TGF/flash ratio holds at all latitudes we can estimate a global rate of N 220 570 TGFs per day. The observed TGF/flash geographical modulation as well as the TGF global rate estimate are in agreement with previous observations. Copyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.

<b>The remarkable γ-ray activity in the gravitationally lensed blazar PKS 1830-211
</b><br>
(2011) Astrophysical Journal Letters, 736 (2), art. no. L30, . 
<br>
ABSTRACT: We report the extraordinary γ-ray activity (E &gt; 100MeV) of the gravitationally lensed blazar PKS 1830-211 (z = 2.507) detected by AGILE between 2010 October and November. On October 14, the source experienced a factor of ∼12 flux increase with respect to its average value and remained brightest at this flux level (∼500 × 10-8photonscm-2s -1) for about four days. The one-month γ-ray light curve across the flare showed a mean flux F(E &gt; 100MeV) = 200 × 10 -8photonscm-2s-1, which resulted in a factor of four enhancement with respect to the average value. Following the γ-ray flare, the source was observed in near-IR (NIR)-optical energy bands at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory and in X-Rays by Swift/X-Ray Telescope and INTEGRAL/IBIS. The main result of these multifrequency observations is that the large variability observed in γ-rays does not have a significant counterpart at lower frequencies: no variation greater than a factor of ∼1.5 appeared in the NIR and X-Ray energy bands. PKS 1830-211 is then a good "γ-ray only flaring" blazar showing substantial variability only above 10-100MeV. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings. (C) 2011.

<b>The brightest gamma-ray flaring blazar in the sky: Agile and multi-wavelength observations of 3C 454.3 during 2010 november

<br>
ABSTRACT: Since 2005, the blazar 3C 454.3 has shown remarkable flaring activity at all frequencies, and during the last four years it has exhibited more than one γ-ray flare per year, becoming the most active γ-ray blazar in the sky. We present for the first time the multi-wavelength AGILE, Swift, INTEGRAL, and GASP-WEBT data collected in order to explain the extraordinary γ-ray flare of 3C 454.3 which occurred in 2010 November. On 2010 November 20 (MJD 55520), 3C 454.3 reached a peak flux (E &gt;100MeV) of F p γ = (6.8 ± 1.0) × 10 -5photons cm -2 s -1 on a timescale of about 12 hr, more than a factor of six higher than the flux of the brightest steady γ-ray source, the Vela pulsar, and more than a factor of three brighter than its previous super-flare on 2009 December 2-3. The multi-wavelength data make possible a thorough study of the present event: the comparison with the previous outbursts indicates a close similarity to the one that occurred in 2009. By comparing the broadband emission before, during, and after the γ-ray flare, we find that the radio, optical, and X-ray emission varies within a factor of 2-3, whereas the γ-ray flux by a factor of 10. This remarkable behavior is modeled by an external Compton component driven by a substantial local enhancement of soft seed photons. (C) 2011. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: During the first 3 years of operation the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector onboard the AGILE satellite detected several blazars in a high γ-ray activity: 3C 279, 3C 454.3, PKS 1510-089, S5 0716+714, 3C 273, W Comae, Mrk 421, PKS 0537-441 and 4C +21.35. Thanks to the rapid dissemination of our alerts, we were able to obtain multiwavelength data from other observatories such as Spitzer, Swift, RXTE, Suzaku, INTEGRAL, MAGIC, VERITAS, and ARGO as well as radio-to-optical coverage by means of the GASP Project of the WEBT and the REM Telescope. This large multifrequency coverage gave us the opportunity to study the variability correlations between the emission at different frequencies and to obtain simultaneous Spectral Energy Distributions of these sources from radio to γ-ray energy bands, investigating the different mechanisms responsible for their emission and uncovering in some cases a more complex behavior with respect to the standard models. We present a review of the most interesting AGILE results on these γ-ray blazars and their multifrequency data. (C) 2011 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

<b>Spectral evolution of the 2010 September gamma-ray flare from the Crab Nebula
</b><br>

<br>
ABSTRACT: Strong gamma-ray flares from the Crab Nebula have been recently discovered by AGILE and confirmed by Fermi-LAT. We study here the spectral evolution in the gamma-ray energy range above 50MeV of the 2010 September flare that was simultaneously detected by AGILE and Fermi-LAT. We revisit the AGILE spectral data and present an emission model based on rapid (within 1 day) acceleration followed by synchrotron cooling. We show that this model successfully explains both the published AGILE and Fermi-LAT spectral data showing a rapid rise and a decay within 2 and 3days. Our analysis constrains the acceleration timescale and mechanism, the properties of the particle distribution function, and the local magnetic field. The combination of very rapid acceleration, emission well above 100MeV, and the spectral evolution consistent with synchrotron cooling contradicts the idealized scenario predicting an exponential cutoff at photon energies above 100MeV. We also consider a variation of our model based on even shorter acceleration and decay timescales, which can be consistent with the published averaged properties. (C) 2011.

<b>AGILE detection of extreme γ -ray activity from the blazar PKS 1510-089 during March 2009: Multifrequency analysis
</b><br>
(2011) Astronomy and Astrophysics, 529, art. no. A145, . Cited 9 times.
<br>
ABSTRACT: We report on the extreme γ-ray activity from the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) PKS 1510-089 observed by the AGILE satellite in March 2009. In the same period a radio-to-optical monitoring of the source was provided by the GASP-WEBT and REM facilities. In the radio band we made use also of multi-epoch 15-GHz Very Long Baseline Array data from the MOJAVE Program to get information on the parsec-scale structure. Moreover, several Swift target of opportunity observations were triggered, adding important information on the source behaviour from optical/UV to hard X-rays. We paid particular attention to the calibration of the Swift/UVOT data to make it suitable to the blazars spectra. Simultaneous observations from radio to γ rays allowed us to study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work during this high activity state of the source. In the period 9-30 March 2009, AGILE detected γ-ray emission from PKS 1510-089 at a significance level of 21.5-σ with an average flux over the entire period of (311 ± 21) × 10 -8 photons cm -2 s -1 for photon energies above 100 MeV, and a peak level of (702 ± 131) × 10 -8 photons cm -2 s -1 on daily integration. The activity detected in γ rays occurred during a period of increasing activity from near-infrared to UV, as monitored by GASP-WEBT, REM and Swift/UVOT. A flaring episode on 26-27 March 2009 was detected from near-IR to UV, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for the flux enhancement observed at the end of March. By contrast, Swift/XRT observations seem to show no clear correlation of the X-ray fluxes with the optical and γ-ray ones. However, the X-ray observations show a harder photon index (Γ x ≃ 1.3-1.6) with respect to most FSRQs and a hint of harder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a second emission component at soft X-ray energies. Moreover, the broad band spectrum from radio-to-UV confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/UV spectrum of PKS 1510-089 also during high γ-ray state. On the other hand, during 25-26 March 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/UV energy band was observed, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission in this part of the spectrum during the brightest γ-ray flare, therefore a significant shift of the synchrotron peak.

ABSTRACT: AGILE has been providing continous monitoring of the Galactic plane in its three years of operation. Thanks to its sensitivity at energies near 100 MeV, AGILE has observed variability and transient behaviour in a number of sources. Simultaneous hard-X-ray coverage, rapid alerts to the astronomical community, and multiwavelength campaigns have provided identifications for some of these sources and placed constraints on others. We provide an overview of these observations and their possible counterparts, including microquasars and colliding wind binaries. (C) Società Italiana di Fisica.

<b>AGILE observation of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes
</b><br>
(2011) Nuovo Cimento della Societa Italiana di Fisica C, 34 (3), pp. 279-284. 
<br>
ABSTRACT: Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) are very short (up to a few milliseconds) energetic bursts of photons and electrons originating from severe thunderstorms mainly in the equatorial and tropical regions. Although several production models have been proposed so far, TGFs still remain a mystery since there is not wide consensus yet on their acceleration mechanism, production sites, maximal energy and fluence. AGILE, operating since mid 2007, is detecting hundreds of TGFs with the Mini-Calorimeter (MCAL) instrument. Thanks to the MCAL energy range extended up to 100 MeV and its flexible trigger logic on sub-millisecond time scales, AGILE is adding a wealth of observations which pose severe constrains on production models. In this paper we will describe the main characteristics of the AGILE TGF sample, focusing on the recent results concerning the first localization of TGFs at gamma-ray energies by means of the AGILE silicon tracker.

ABSTRACT: Since its early phases of operation, the AGILE mission is successfully observing Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the hard X-ray band with the SuperAGILE imager and in the MeV range with the Mini-Calorimeter. Up to now, three firm GRB detections were obtained above 25 MeV and some bursts were detected with lower statistical confidence in the same energy band. When a GRB is localized, either by SuperAGILE or Swift/BAT or INTEGRAL/IBIS or Fermi/GBM or IPN, inside the field of view of the Gamma Ray Imager of AGILE, a detection is searched for in the gamma ray band or an upper limit is provided. A promising result of AGILE is the detection of very short gamma ray transients, a few ms in duration and possibly identified with Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes. In this paper we show the current status of the observation of Gamma Ray Bursts and Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes with AGILE. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<b>Galactic sources science with AGILE: The case of the Carina Region
</b><br>
(2011) Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment, 630 (1), pp. 193-197. 
<br>
ABSTRACT: During its first 2 years of operation, the gamma-ray AGILE satellite accumulated an extensive dataset for the Galactic plane. The data have been monitored for transient sources and several gamma-ray sources were detected. Their variability and possible association were studied. In this talk we will focus on the results of extensive observations of the Carina Region during the time period 2007 July2009 January, for a total livetime of ∼130 days. The region is extremely complex, hosting massive star formation, with the remarkable colliding wind binary Eta Carinae, massive star clusters and HII regions (e.g. NGC 3324, RCW49, Westerlund II) and a giant molecular cloud extending over 150 pc (between l=284.7 and 289). The Carina Nebula itself is the largest and IR highest surface brightness nebula of the Southern emisphere. We monitored several gamma ray sources in the Carina Region. In particular we detect a gamma ray source (1AGL J1043-5931) consistent with the position of Eta Carinae and report a remarkable 2-days gamma-ray flaring episode from this source on 2008 October 1113. If 1AGL J1043-5931 is associated with the Eta Car system, our data provide the long sought first detection above 100 MeV of a colliding wind binary. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<b>The flaring blazars of the first 1.5 years of the AGILE mission

ABSTRACT: We report the AGILE γ-ray observations and the results of the multiwavelength campaigns on seven flaring blazars detected by the mission: During two multiwavelength campaigns, we observed γ-ray activity from two Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars of the Virgo region, e.g. 3C 279 and 3C 273 (the latter being the first extragalactic source simultaneously observed with the γ-ray telescope and the hard X ray imager of the mission). Due to the large FOV of the AGILE/GRID instrument, we achieved an almost continuous coverage of the FSRQ 3C 454.3. The source showed flux above 10 -6 photons/cm 2/s (E&gt;100MeV) and showed day by day variability during all the AGILE observing periods. In the EGRET era, the source was found in high γ-ray activity only once. An other blazar, PKS 1510-089 was frequently found in high γ-ray activity. S5 071671, an intermediate BL Lac object, exhibited a very high γ-ray activity and fast γ-ray variability during a period of intense optical activity. We observed high γ-ray activity from W Comae, a BL Lac object, and Mrk 421, a high energy peaked BL Lac object. For this source, a multiwavelength campaign from optical to TeV has been performed.

ABSTRACT: The AGILE scientific instrument has been calibrated with a tagged γ-ray beam at the Beam Test Facility (BTF) of the INFN Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (LNF). The goal of the calibration was the measure of the Point Spread Function (PSF) as a function of the photon energy and incident angle and the validation of the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the silicon tracker operation. The calibration setup is described and some preliminary results are presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<b>Discovery of powerful gamma-ray flares from the Crab Nebula
</b><br>
(2011) Science, 331 (6018), pp. 736-739. Cited 56 times.
<br>
ABSTRACT: The well-known Crab Nebula is at the center of the SN1054 supernova remnant. It consists of a rotationally powered pulsar interacting with a surrounding nebula through a relativistic particle wind. The emissions originating from the pulsar and nebula have been considered to be essentially stable. Here, we report the detection of strong gamma-ray (100 mega-electron volts to 10 giga-electron volts) flares observed by the AGILE satellite in September 2010 and October 2007. In both cases, the total gamma-ray flux increased by a factor of three compared with the non-flaring flux. The flare luminosity and short time scale favor an origin near the pulsar, and we discuss Chandra Observatory x-ray and Hubble Space Telescope optical follow-up observations of the nebula. Our observations challenge standard models of nebular emission and require power-law acceleration by shock-driven plasma wave turbulence within an approximately 1-day time scale.

<b>Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes as powerful particle accelerators
</b><br>

ABSTRACT: Strong electric discharges associated with thunderstorms can produce terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs), i.e., intense bursts of x-rays and γ-rays lasting a few milliseconds or less. We present in this Letter new TGF timing and spectral data based on the observations of the Italian Space Agency AGILE satellite. We determine that the TGF emission above 10 MeV has a significant power-law spectral component reaching energies up to 100 MeV. These results challenge TGF theoretical models based on runaway electron acceleration. The TGF discharge electric field accelerates particles over the large distances for which maximal voltages of hundreds of megavolts can be established. The combination of huge potentials and large electric fields in TGFs can efficiently accelerate particles in large numbers, and we reconsider here the photon spectrum and the neutron production by photonuclear reactions in the atmosphere.

<b>Study of the γ -ray source 1AGL J2022+4032 in the Cygnus region
</b><br>

ABSTRACT: Context. Identification of γ-ray-emitting Galactic sources is a long-standing problem in astrophysics. One such source, 1AGL J2022+4032, coincident with the interior of the radio shell of the supernova remnant Gamma Cygni (SNR G78.2+2.1) in the Cygnus region, has recently been identified by Fermi as a γ-ray pulsar, LAT PSR J2021+4026. Aims. We present long-term observations of 1AGL J2022+4032 with the AGILE γ-ray telescope, measuring its flux and light curve. Methods. We compare the light curve of 1AGL J2022+4032 with that of 1AGL J2021+3652 (PSR J2021+3651), showing that the flux variability of 1AGL J2022+4032 appears to be greater than the level predicted from statistical and systematic effects and producing detailed simulations to estimate the probability of the apparent observed variability. Results. We evaluate the possibility that the γ-ray emission may be due to the superposition of two or more point sources, some of which may be variable, considering a number of possible counterparts. Conclusions. We consider the possibility of a nearby X-ray quiet microquasar contributing to the flux of 1AGL J2022+4032 to be more likely than the hypotheses of a background blazar or intrinsic γ-ray variabilty of LAT PSR J2021+4026.

<b>AGILE detection of intense γ -ray activity from the blazar PKS 0537-441 in October 2008
</b><br>
(2010) Astronomy and Astrophysics, 522 (8), art. no. A109, . Cited 3 times.

ABSTRACT: Context. We report the detection by the AGILE satellite of intense γ-ray activity from the source 1AGL J0538-4424, associated with the low-energy-peaked BL Lac PKS 0537-441, during a target of opportunity (ToO) observation performed on 2008 October 10-17, triggered by a Fermi-LAT alert, together with REM and Swift observations. Aims. The quasi-simultaneous near-infrared, optical, UV, X-ray, and γ-ray coverage allowed us to investigate the behaviour of the source in different energy bands and study the spectral energy distribution and a theoretical model that can describe the γ-ray state observed in mid-October. Methods. AGILE observed the source with its two co-aligned imagers: the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) and the hard X-ray imager (SuperAGILE), sensitive in the 30 MeV-30 GeV and 18-60 keV ranges, respectively. During the AGILE observation, the source was monitored simultaneously in the UV and X-ray bands by the Swift satellite through 6 ToO observations carried out between 2008 October 8 and 17. Moreover, the source was observed in the near-infrared and optical bands by the REM telescope on 2008 October 7, 8, and 9. Results. During 2008 October 10-17, AGILE-GRID detected γ-ray emission from PKS 0537-441 at a significance level of 5.3-σ with an average flux of (42 ± 11) × 10 -8 photons cm -2 s -1 for energies higher than 100 MeV. A significant increase in the γ-ray activity was detected between the first and the second halves of the observing period. REM and Swift/XRT detected the source in near-infrared/optical and X-rays during a relatively low and intermediate activity state, respectively, with no signs of evident variability in the different observations. However, Swift/UVOT detected an increase between the first and the second parts of the observing period, smaller than in the γ-rays. Conclusions. The average γ-ray flux of PKS 0537-441 detected by AGILE is close to the average flux observed for this source by the EGRET and Fermi-LAT instruments, with an increase of a factor 3 throughout the observation period up to a flux level slightly lower than the highest flux observed by Fermi-LAT during the first 11 months of operation. The spectral energy distribution of PKS 0537-441 in mid-October 2008 seems to require two synchrotron self-Compton components to be modelled, to account for both the near-infrared/optical bump and the X-ray data, together with the information on the γ-ray flux level observed by AGILE. An alternative model based on the external Compton radiation, which requires an accretion disk with a relatively high luminosity, is also proposed. (C) 2010 ESO.

<b>AGile observations of the "soft" gamma-ray pulsar psr b1509-58
</b><br>
(2010) Astrophysical Journal Letters, 723 (1), pp. 707-712. Cited 7 times.
<br>
ABSTRACT: We present the results of new AGILE observations of PSR B1509-58 performed over a period of ∼2.5 years following the detection obtained with a subset of the present data. The modulation significance of the light curve above 30 MeV is at a 5σ confidence level and the light curve is similar to those found earlier by COMPTEL up to 30 MeV: a broad asymmetric first peak reaching its maximum 0.39 ± 0.02 cycles after the radio peak plus a second peak at 0.94 ± 0.03. The gamma-ray spectral energy distribution of the pulsed flux detected by COMPTEL and AGILE is well described by a power law (photon index α = 1.87 ± 0.09) with a remarkable cutoff at Ec = 81 ± 20 MeV, representing the softest spectrum observed among gamma-ray pulsars so far. The pulsar luminosity at E &gt; 1MeVis Lγ = 4.2 +0.5 -0.2×1035 erg s-1, assuming a distance of 5.2 kpc, which implies a spin-down conversion efficiency to gamma rays of ∼0.03. The unusual soft break in the spectrum of PSR B1509-58 has been interpreted in the framework of polar cap models as a signature of the exotic photon-splitting process in the strong magnetic field of this pulsar. In this interpretation, our spectrum constrains the magnetic altitude of the emission point(s) at 3 km above the neutron star surface, implying that the attenuation may not be as strong as formerly suggested because pair production can substitute photon splitting into regions of the magnetosphere where the magnetic field becomes too low to sustain photon splitting. In the case of an outer-gap scenario or the two-pole caustic model, better constraints on the geometry of the emission would be needed from the radio band in order to establish whether the conditions required by the models to reproduce AGILE light curves and spectra match the polarization measurements.

<b>A year-long AGILE observation of Cygnus X-1 in hard spectral state
</b><br>
(2010) Astronomy and Astrophysics, 520 (10), art. no. 67, . Cited 2 times.
<br>
ABSTRACT: Context. Cygnus X-1 (Cyg X-1) is a high mass X-ray binary system, known to be a black hole candidate and one of the brightest sources in the X-ray sky, which shows both variability on all timescales and frequent flares. The source spends most of the time in a hard spectral state, dominated by a power-law emission, with occasional transitions to the soft and intermediate states, where a strong blackbody component emerges. Aims. We present the observation of Cyg X-1 in a hard spectral state performed during the AGILE science verification phase and observing cycle 1 in hard X-rays (with SuperAGILE) and gamma rays (with the gamma ray imaging detector) and lasting for about 160 days with a live time of ∼6 Ms. Methods. We investigated the variability of Cyg X-1 in hard X-rays on different timescales, from ∼300 s up to one day, and we applied different tools of timing analysis, such as the autocorrelation function, the first-order structure function, and the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, to our data (from SuperAGILE) and to the simultaneous data in soft X-rays (from RXTE/ASM). We concluded our investigation with a search for emission in the energy range above 100 MeV with the maximum likelihood technique. Results. In the hard X-ray band, the flux of Cyg X-1 shows its typical erratic fluctuations on all timescales with variations of about a factor of two that do not significantly affect the shape of the energy spectrum. From the first-order structure function, we find that the X-ray emission of Cyg X-1 is characterized by antipersistence (anticorrelation in the time series, with an increase in the emission likely followed by a decrease), indicative of a negative feedback mechanism at work. In the gamma ray data a statistically significant point-like source at the position of Cyg X-1 is not found, and the upper limit on the flux is 5 × 10 -8 ph cm -2 s -1 over the whole observation (160 days). Finally we compared our upper limit in gamma rays with the expectation of various models of the Cyg X-1 emission, both of hadronic and leptonic origin, in the GeV-TeV band. Conclusions. The time history of Cyg X-1 in the hard X-ray band over 13 months (not continuous) is shown. Different analysis tools do not provide fully converging results of the characteristic timescales in the system, suggesting that the timescales found in the structure function are not intrinsic to the physics of the source. While Cyg X-1 is not detected in gamma rays, our upper limit is a factor of two lower than the EGRET one and is compatible with the extrapolation of the flux measured by COMPTEL in the same spectral state.

<b>The 2009 december gamma-ray flare of 3C 454.3: The multifrequency campaign

ABSTRACT: During the month of 2009 December, the blazar 3C 454.3 became the brightest gamma-ray source in the sky, reaching a peak flux F 2000 × 10 -8 photons cm -2 s -1 for E &gt; 100 MeV. Starting in 2009 November intensive multifrequency campaigns monitored the 3C 454 gamma-ray outburst. Here, we report on the results of a two-month campaign involving AGILE, INTEGRAL, Swift/XRT, Swift/BAT, and Rossi XTE for the high-energy observations and Swift/UVOT, KANATA, Goddard Robotic Telescope, and REM for the near-IR/optical/UV data. GASP/WEBT provided radio and additional optical data. We detected a long-term active emission phase lasting 1 month at all wavelengths: in the gamma-ray band, peak emission was reached on 2009 December 2-3. Remarkably, this gamma-ray super-flare was not accompanied by correspondingly intense emission in the optical/UV band that reached a level substantially lower than the previous observations in 2007-2008. The lack of strong simultaneous optical brightening during the super-flare and the determination of the broadband spectral evolution severely constrain the theoretical modeling. We find that the pre- and post-flare broadband behavior can be explained by a one-zone model involving synchrotron self-Compton plus external Compton emission from an accretion disk and a broad-line region. However, the spectra of the 2009 December 2-3 super-flare and of the secondary peak emission on 2009 December 9 cannot be satisfactorily modeled by a simple one-zone model. An additional particle component is most likely active during these states. (C) 2010. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.

<b>Gamma-ray localization of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes
</b><br>
(2010) Physical Review Letters, 105 (12), art. no. 128501, . Cited 8 times.
<br>
ABSTRACT: Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) are very short bursts of high-energy photons and electrons originating in Earth's atmosphere. We present here a localization study of TGFs carried out at gamma-ray energies above 20a MeV based on an innovative event selection method. We use the AGILE satellite Silicon Tracker data that for the first time have been correlated with TGFs detected by the AGILE Mini-Calorimeter. We detect 8a TGFs with gamma-ray photons of energies above 20A MeV localized by the AGILE gamma-ray imager with an accuracy of ∼5-10° at 50A MeV. Remarkably, all TGF-associated gamma rays are compatible with a terrestrial production site closer to the subsatellite point than 400A km. Considering that our gamma rays reach the AGILE satellite at 540A km altitude with limited scattering or attenuation, our measurements provide the first precise direct localization of TGFs from space.

<b>Multi-wavelength observations of the powerful gamma-ray blazar PKS 1510-089
</b><br>
(2010) AIP Conference Proceedings, 1248, pp. 415-416. 
<br>
ABSTRACT: PKS 1510-089 is a Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar at z=0.361 with radiative output dominated by the γ-ray component and high variability over the whole electromagnetic spectrum. In particular, in the last two years very high γ-ray activity was detected by AGILE with flaring episodes in August 2007 and March 2008 and an extraordinary activity during March 2009. Observations in optical/UV seems to indicate the presence of Seyfert-like features in the broad band spectrum of PKS 1510-089, such as the little and big blue bumps. Moreover, X-ray observations in March 2008 show a harder-when-brighter behaviour quite rare in FSRQs. We present the multiwavelength data of PKS 1510-089 collected by GASP-WEBT, REM, Swift and AGILE during these γ-ray flares. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

<b>AGILE detection of GeV γ -ray emission from the SNR W28
</b><br>
(2010) Astronomy and Astrophysics, 516 (12), . Cited 4 times.
<br>
ABSTRACT: Aims. Supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to be the main sources of Galactic cosmic rays. Molecular clouds associated with SNRs can produce gamma-ray emission by means of the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentrated gas. The middle-aged SNR W28, because of its associated system of dense molecular clouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. Methods. We present the AGILE/GRID observations of SNR W28, and compare them with observations at other wavelengths (TeV and 12CO (J=1rightarrow 0) molecular line emission). Results. The gamma-ray flux detected by AGILE from the dominant source associated with W28 is (14 ± 5) × 10 -8 phcm -2s -1 for E &gt; 400 MeV. This source is positionally well correlated with the TeV emission observed by the HESS telescope. The local variations in the GeV to TeV flux ratio imply that there is a difference between the CR spectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. A model based on a hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds at different distances from the W28 shell can explain both the morphological and spectral features observed by both AGILE in the MeV-GeV energy range and the HESS telescope in the TeV energy range. The combined set of AGILE and H.E.S.S. data strongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in W28. (C) 2010 ESO.

<b>Temporal properties of GX 301-2 over a year-long observation with SuperAGILE

<br>
ABSTRACT: We present the long-term monitoring of the high-mass X-ray binary GX 301-2 performed with the SuperAGILE (SA) instrument on-board the Astro-rivelatore Gamma ad Immagini LEggero (AGILE) mission. The source was monitored in the 20-60 keV energy band during the first year of the mission from 2007 July 17 to 2008 August 31, covering about one whole orbital period and three more pre-periastron (PP) passages for a total net observation time of about 3.7 Ms. The SA data set represents one of the most continuous and complete monitoring at hard X-ray energies of the 41.5 days long binary period available to date. The source behavior was characterized at all orbital phases in terms of hard X-ray flux, spectral hardness, spin-period history, pulsed fraction, and pulse shape profile. We also complemented the SA observations with the soft X-ray data of the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer/All-Sky Monitor. Our analysis shows a clear orbital modulation of the spectral hardness, with peaks in correspondence with the PP flare and near phase 0.25. The hardness peaks, we found, could be related with the wind-plus-stream accretion model proposed in order to explain the orbital light-curve modulation of GX 301-2. Timing analysis of the pulsar spin period shows that the secular trend of the ∼ 680 s pulse period is consistent with the previous observations, although there is evidence of a slight decrease in the spin-down rate. The analysis of the hard X-ray-pulsed emission also showed a variable pulse shape profile as a function of the orbital phase, with substructures detected near the passage at the periastron, and a clear modulation of the pulsed fraction, which appears in turn strongly anticorrelated with the source intensity.

<b>Agile detection of delayed gamma-ray emission from the short gamma-ray burst GRB 090510
</b><br>
(2010) Astrophysical Journal Letters, 708 (2 PART 2), pp. L84-L88. Cited 18 times.
<br>
ABSTRACT: Short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), typically lasting less than 2 s, are a special class of GRBs of great interest. We report the detection by the AGILE satellite of the short GRB 090510 which shows two clearly distinct emission phases: a prompt phase lasting ∼200ms and a second phase lasting tens of seconds. The prompt phase is relatively intense in the 0.3-10 MeV range with a spectrum characterized by a large peak/cutoff energy near 3 MeV; in this phase, no significant high-energy gamma-ray emission is detected. At the end of the prompt phase, intense gamma-ray emission above 30 MeV is detected showing a power-law time decay of the flux of the type t -1.3 and a broadband spectrum remarkably different from that of the prompt phase. It extends from sub-MeV to hundreds of MeV energies with a photon index α ≃ 1.5. GRB 090510 provides the first case of a short GRB with delayed gamma-ray emission. We present the timing and spectral data of GRB 090510 and briefly discuss its remarkable properties within the current models of gamma-ray emission of short GRBs. (C) 2010.

<b>Direct evidence for hadronic cosmic-ray acceleration in the supernova remnant IC 443
</b><br>
(2010) Astrophysical Journal Letters, 710 (2 PART 2), pp. L151-L155. Cited 33 times.
<br>
ABSTRACT: The supernova remnant (SNR) IC 443 is an intermediate-age remnant well known for its radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray energy emissions. In this Letter, we study the gamma-ray emission above 100MeV from IC 443 as obtained by the AGILE satellite. A distinct pattern of diffuse emission in the energy range 100MeV-3GeV is detected across the SNR with its prominent maximum (source "A") localized in the northeastern shell with a flux F = (47±10) × 10?8 photons cm?2 s?1 above 100MeV. This location is the site of the strongest shock interaction between the SNR blast wave and the dense circumstellar medium. Source "A" is not coincident with the TeV source located 0.4° away and associated with a dense molecular cloud complex in the SNR central region. From our observations, and from the lack of detectable diffuse TeV emission from its northeastern rim, we demonstrate that electrons cannot be the main emitters of gamma rays in the range 0.1-10GeV at the site of the strongest SNR shock. The intensity, spectral characteristics, and location of the most prominent gamma-ray emission together with the absence of cospatial detectable TeV emission are consistent only with a hadronic model of cosmic-ray acceleration in the SNR. A high-density molecular cloud (cloud "E") provides a remarkable "target" for nucleonic interactions of accelerated hadrons; our results show enhanced gamma-ray production near the molecular cloud/shocked shell interaction site. IC 443 provides the first unambiguous evidence of cosmic-ray acceleration by SNRs. (C) 2010. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Cygnus X-1 (Cyg X-1) is the archetypal black hole binary system in our Galaxy. We report the main results of an extensive search for transient gamma-ray emission from Cygnus X-1 carried out in the energy range 100 MeV-3GeV by the AGILE satellite, during the period 2007 July-2009 October. The total exposure time is about 300 days, during which the source was in the "hard" X-ray spectral state. We divided the observing intervals in 2-4 week periods, and searched for transient and persistent emission. We report an episode of significant transient gamma-ray emission detected on 2009 October 16 in a position compatible with Cyg X-1 optical position. This episode, which occurred during a hard spectral state of Cyg X-1, shows that a 1-2 day time variable emission above 100 MeV can be produced during hard spectral states, having important theoretical implications for current Comptonization models for Cyg X-1 and other microquasars. Except for this one short timescale episode, no significant gamma-ray emission was detected by AGILE. By integrating all available data, we obtain a 2σ upper limit for the total integrated flux of F γ,U.L. = 3 × 10 -8 ph cm -2 s -1 in the energy range 100 MeV-3 GeV. We then clearly establish the existence of a spectral cutoff in the energy range 1-100 MeV that applies to the typical hard state outside the flaring period and that confirms the historically known spectral cutoff above 1 MeV.

<b>Multiwavelength observations of 3C 454.3. III. Eighteen months of agile monitoring of the "crazy diamond"

ABSTRACT: We report on 18 months of multiwavelength observations of the blazar 3C 454.3 (Crazy Diamond) carried out in the period 2007 July-2009 January. In particular, we show the results of the AGILE campaigns which took place on 2008 May-June, 2008 July-August, and 2008 October-2009 January. During the 2008 May-2009 January period, the source average flux was highly variable, with a clear fading trend toward the end of the period, from an average γ-ray flux F E&gt;100 MeV ≳ 200 × 10-8photonscm -2s-1 in 2008 May-June, to F E&gt;100 MeV 80 × 10-8photonscm-2s-1 in 2008 October-2009 January. The average γ-ray spectrum between 100 MeV and 1 GeV can be fit by a simple power law, showing a moderate softening (from ΓGRID ∼ 2.0 to ΓGRID ∼ 2.2) toward the end of the observing campaign. Only 3σ upper limits can be derived in the 20-60 keV energy band with Super-AGILE, because the source was considerably off-axis during the whole time period. In 2007 July-August and 2008 May-June, 3C 454.3 was monitored by Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The RXTE/Proportional Counter Array (PCA) light curve in the 3-20 keV energy band shows variability correlated with the γ-ray one. The RXTE/PCA average flux during the two time periods is F 3-20 keV = 8.4 × 10-11ergcm-2s -1, and F 3-20 keV = 4.5 × 10 -11ergcm-2s-1, respectively, while the spectrum (a power law with photon index ΓPCA = 1.65 0.02) does not show any significant variability. Consistent results are obtained with the analysis of the RXTE/High-Energy X-Ray Timing Experiment quasi-simultaneous data. We also carried out simultaneous Swift observations during all AGILE campaigns. Swift/XRT detected 3C 454.3 with an observed flux in the 2-10 keV energy band in the range (0.9-7.5) × 10-11ergcm-2s-1 and a photon index in the range ΓXRT = 1.33-2.04. In the 15-150 keV energy band, when detected, the source has an average flux of about 5mCrab. GASP-WEBT monitored 3C 454.3 during the whole 2007-2008 period in the radio, millimeter, near-IR, and optical bands. The observations show an extremely variable behavior at all frequencies, with flux peaks almost simultaneous with those at higher energies. A correlation analysis between the optical and the γ-ray fluxes shows that the γ-optical correlation occurs with a time lag of τ = -0.4+0.6 -0.8 days, consistent with previous findings for this source. An analysis of 15 GHz and 43 GHz VLBI core radio flux observations in the period 2007 July-2009 February shows an increasing trend of the core radio flux, anti-correlated with the higher frequency data, allowing us to derive the value of the source magnetic field. Finally, the modeling of the broadband spectral energy distributions for the still unpublished data, and the behavior of the long-term light curves in different energy bands, allow us to compare the jet properties during different emission states, and to study the geometrical properties of the jet on a time-span longer than one year.

<b>Detection of terrestrial gamma ray flashes up to 40 MeV by the AGILE satellite

ABSTRACT: We report the detection by the Astrorivelatore Gamma a Immagini Leggero (AGILE) satellite of terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs) obtained with the minicalorimeter (MCAL) detector operating in the energy range 0.3-100 MeV. We select events typically lasting a few milliseconds with spectral and directional selections consistent with the TGF characteristics previously reported by other space missions. During the period 1 June 2008 to 31 March 2009 we detect 34 high-confidence events showing millisecond durations and a geographical distribution peaked over continental Africa and Southeast Asia. For the first time, AGILE-MCAL detects photons associated with TGF events up to 40 MeV. We determine the cumulative spectral properties of the spectrum in the range 0.5-40 MeV, which can be effectively described by a Bremsstrahlung spectrum. We find that both the TGF cumulative spectral properties and their geographical distribution are in good agreement with the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) results.

ABSTRACT: AGILE is an ASI (Italian Space Agency) Small Scientific Mission dedicated to high-energy astrophysics which was successfully launched on April 23, 2007. The AGILE instrument is composed of three main detectors: a Tungsten-Silicon Tracker designed to detect and image photons in the 30 MeV-50 GeV energy band, an X-ray imager called Super-AGILE operating in the 18-60 keV energy band, and a Mini-Calorimeter that detects gamma-rays and charged particles energy deposits between 300 keV and 100 MeV. The instrument is surrounded by an anti-coincidence (AC) system. In this paper, we present the noise characterization and the front-end configuration of the Silicon Tracker. Two crucial (and unique, among gamma-ray astrophysics missions) characteristic of the AGILE Silicon Tracker are the analog signal acquisition (aimed at obtaining an optimal angular resolution for gamma-ray imaging) and the very small dimension of the instrument (the total height including the active elements is ∼ 21 cm and therefore the Silicon Tracker is the lightest and most compact γ - ray imager sent in orbit). The results presented in this paper were obtained during the AIV (Assembly, Integration and Verification) pre-launch testing phase and during the post-launch commissioning phase. The AGILE Silicon Tracker has been optimally configured with a very good response of the frontend system and of the data acquisition units. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<b>Detection of gamma-ray emission from the Vela pulsar wind nebula with AGILE
</b><br>
(2010) Science, 327 (5966), pp. 663-665. Cited 16 times.

ABSTRACT: Pulsars are known to power winds of relativistic particles that can produce bright nebulae by interacting with the surrounding medium. These pulsar wind nebulae are observed by their radio, optical, and x-ray emissions, and in some cases also at TeV (teraelectron volt) energies, but the lack of information in the gamma-ray band precludes drawing a comprehensive multiwavelength picture of their phenomenology and emission mechanisms. Using data from the AGILE satellite, we detected the Vela pulsar wind nebula in the energy range from 100 MeV to 3 GeV. This result constrains the particle population responsible for the GeV emission and establishes a class of gamma-ray emitters that could account for a fraction of the unidentified galactic gamma-ray sources.

<b>Monitoring the hard X-ray sky with SuperAGILE

ABSTRACT: Context. SuperAGILE is the hard X-ray monitor of the AGILE gamma ray mission, in orbit since 23 April 2007. It is an imaging experiment based on a set of four independent silicon strip detectors, equipped with one-dimensional coded masks, operating in the nominal energy range 18-60 keV. Aims. The main goal of SuperAGILE is the observation of cosmic sources simultaneously with the main gamma-ray AGILE experiment, the Gamma Ray Imaging Detector (GRID). Given its ~steradian-wide field of view and its ~15 mCrab day-sensitivity, SuperAGILE is also well suited to the long-term monitoring of Galactic compact objects and the detection of bright transients. Methods. The SuperAGILE detector properties and design allow for a 6 arcmin angular resolution in each of the two independent orthogonal projections of the celestial coordinates. Photon by photon data are continuously available by means of experiment telemetry, and are used to derive images and fluxes of individual sources, with integration × depending on the source intensity and position in the field of view. Results. We report on the main scientific results achieved by SuperAGILE over its first two years in orbit, until April 2009. The scientific observations started in mid-July 2007, with the science verification phase, continuing during the complete AGILE Cycle 1 and the first half of Cycle 2. Despite the largely non-uniform sky coverage, due to the pointing strategy of the AGILE mission, a few tens of Galactic sources were monitored, some× for unprecedently long continuous periods, leading to the detection also of several bursts and outbursts. Approximately one gamma ray burst per month was detected and localized, allowing for prompt multiwavelength observations. A few extragalactic sources in bright states were occasionally detected as well. The light curves of sources measured by SuperAGILE are made publicly available on the web in almost real-time. To enable a proper scientific use of these, we provide the reader with the relevant scientific and technical background. (C) ESO, 2010.

<b>Extreme particle acceleration in the microquasar Cygnus X-3
</b><br>
(2009) Nature, 462 (7273), pp. 620-623. Cited 54 times.
<br>
ABSTRACT: Super-massive black holes in active galaxies can accelerate particles to relativistic energies, producing jets with associated γ-ray emission. Galactic ĝ€ microquasarsĝ€™, which are binary systems consisting of a neutron star or stellar-mass black hole accreting gas from a companion star, also produce relativistic jets, generally together with radio flares. Apart from an isolated event detected in Cygnus X-1, there has hitherto been no systematic evidence for the acceleration of particles to gigaelectronvolt or higher energies in a microquasar, with the consequence that we are as yet unsure about the mechanism of jet energization. Here we report four γ-ray flares with energies above 100 MeV from the microquasar Cygnus X-3 (an exceptional X-ray binary that sporadically produces radio jets). There is a clear pattern of temporal correlations between the γ-ray flares and transitional spectral states of the radio-frequency and X-ray emission. Particle acceleration occurred a few days before radio-jet ejections for two of the four flares, meaning that the process of jet formation implies the production of very energetic particles. In Cygnus X-3, particle energies during the flares can be thousands of times higher than during quiescent states. (C) 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

<b>AGILE detection of a rapid γ-ray flare from the blazar PKS 1510-089 during the GASP-WEBT monitoring

ABSTRACT: Aims. We report the detection by the AGILE satellite of a rapid γ-ray flare from the source 1AGL J1511-0908, associated with the powerful γ-ray quasar PKS 1510-089, during a pointing centered on the Galactic center region from 1 March to 30 March 2008. This source has been continuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the GLAST-AGILE Support Program (GASP) of the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT). Moreover, the γ-ray flaring episode triggered three ToO observations by the swift satellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 March 2008. The quasi-simultaneous radio-to-optical, UV, X-ray and γ-ray coverage allows us to make a detailed study of the multifrequency time evolution, the spectral energy distribution of this source, and its theoretical interpretation based on the synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) emission mechanisms.Methods. During the radio-to-optical monitoring provided by the GASP-WEBT, AGILE observed the source with its two co-aligned imagers, the gamma-ray imaging detector (GRID) and the hard X-ray imager (SuperAGILE), which are sensitive in the 30 MeV-30 GeV and 18-60 keV energy bands, respectively.Results. In the period 1-16 March 2008, AGILE detected γ-ray emission from PKS 1510-089 at a significance level of 6.2-σ with an average flux over the entire period of (84±17)×10 -8 photons cm-2 s-1 for photon energies above 100 MeV. After a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 March 2008, AGILE detected the source at a significance level of 7.3-σ, with an average flux (E&lt; 100 MeV) of (134±29)×10-8 photons cm-2s-1 and a peak level of (281±68)×10 -8 photons cm-2s-1 with daily integration. During the observing period January-April 2008, the source also showed an intense and variable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significant increase in the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. Moreover, in the X-ray band, the swift/XRT observations seem to show a harder-when-brighter behavior of the source spectrum.Conclusions. The flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1510-089 showed strong activity between January and April 2008, with episodes of rapid variability from radio to γ-ray energy bands, in particular with a rapid γ-ray flaring episode. The spectral energy distribution of mid-March 2008 is modeled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self Compton (SSC) emission plus contributions from inverse Compton scattering of external photons from both the accretion disk and the broad line region. Indeed, some features in the optical-UV spectrum seem to indicate Seyfert-like components such as the little and the big blue bumps. (C) 2009 ESO.

ABSTRACT: We report on the second Astrorivelatore Gamma a Immagini Leggero (AGILE) multiwavelength campaign of the blazar 3C 454.3 during the first half of 2007 December. This campaign involved AGILE, Spitzer, Swift, Suzaku, the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) consortium, the Rapid Eye Mount (REM), and the Multicolor Imaging Telescopes for Survey and Monstrous Explosions (MITSuME) telescopes, offering a broadband coverage that allowed for a simultaneous sampling of the synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) emissions. The two-week AGILE monitoring was accompanied by radio to optical monitoring by WEBT and REM, and by sparse observations in mid-infrared and soft/hard X-ray energy bands performed by means of Target of Opportunity observations by Spitzer, Swift, and Suzaku, respectively. The source was detected with an average flux of ∼250 × 10-8photonscm-2s-1 above 100 MeV, typical of its flaring states. The simultaneous optical and γ-ray monitoring allowed us to study the time lag associated with the variability in the two energy bands, resulting in a possible ≲one-day delay of the γ-ray emission with respect to the optical one. From the simultaneous optical and γ-ray fast flare detected on December 12, we can constrain the delay between the γ-ray and optical emissions within 12 hr. Moreover, we obtain three spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with simultaneous data for 2007 December 5, 13, and 15, characterized by the widest multifrequency coverage. We found that a model with an external Compton on seed photons by a standard disk and reprocessed by the broad-line regions does not describe in a satisfactory way the SEDs of 2007 December 5, 13, and 15. An additional contribution, possibly from the hot corona with T = 106 K surrounding the jet, is required to account simultaneously for the softness of the synchrotron and the hardness of the IC emissions during those epochs.

<b>Powerful high-energy emission of the remarkable BL Lac object S5 0716+714
</b><br>

ABSTRACT: BL Lac objects of the intermediate subclass (IBLs) are known to emit a substantial fraction of their power in the energy range 0.1-10 GeV. Detecting γ-ray emission from such sources provides therefore a direct probe of the emission mechanisms and of the underlying powerhouse. The γ-ray satellite, AGILE, detected the remarkable IBL S5 0716+714 (z ≃ 0.3) during a high state in the period from 2007 September-October, marked by two very intense flares reaching peak fluxes of 200 × 10 -8 photons cm -2 s -1 above 100 MeV, with simultaneous optical and X-ray observations. We present here a theoretical model for the two major flares and discuss the overall energetics of the source. We conclude that 0716+714 is among the brightest BL Lac's ever detected at γ-ray energies. Because of its high power and lack of signs for ongoing accretion or surrounding gas, the source is an ideal candidate to test the maximal power extractable from a rotating supermassive black hole via the pure Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We find that during the 2007 γ-ray flares 0716+714 approached or just exceeded the upper limit set by BZ for a black hole of mass 10 9 M ·. (C) 2009. The American Astronomical Society.

<b>Search for very short bursts with the AGILE mini-calorimeter
</b><br>
(2009) AIP Conference Proceedings, 1133, pp. 415-417. 
<br>
ABSTRACT: In this paper the results of the first months of burst search on very short time scales with the Mini-Calorimeter (MCAL) on-board the AGILE mission are presented. MCAL is equipped with a flexible on-board trigger logic for autonomous GRB detection. In addition to standard trigger time windows, MCAL has been equipped with trigger capabilities on 16 ms, 1 ms and sub-millisecond time windows. Since June 2008 burst search on these short time scales has been enabled, resulting in an average rate of 4 triggers/orbit, compliant with telemetry budget. An on-ground rejection strategy is applied, allowing more sophisticated selection criteria than those allowed by the on-board trigger logic. Triggers due to instrumental effects or geophysical phenomena can be spotted due to their photon-by-photon pattern; what remains after this cleaning is an almost unexplored territory and could shed light on the origin of very short bursts. The trigger criteria, as well as the on-ground rejection strategy and the properties of the selected events will be described and discussed. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

<b>The status of the AGILE GRB observations and the noticeable case of GRB 080514B
</b><br>
(2009) AIP Conference Proceedings, 1133, pp. 12-17. 
<br>
ABSTRACT: Since Summer 2007, the AGILE mission is successfully detecting and localizing Gamma Ray Bursts by using its widefield hard X-ray monitor SuperAGILE (17 - 60 keV) and its Csl Minicalorimeter (0.3 - 20 MeV). Moreover, all the events with a known localization in the field of view of the Gamma Ray Imaging Detector are searched for in the 30 MeV - 50 GeV energy range. Among the several bursts occurred in the field of view of the Gamma Ray Imaging Detector during more than one year of operations, at the time of writing the remarkable GRB 080514B is detected at high significance and GRB 080721 and GRB 081001 are detected at low significance. GRB 080514B is the first Gamma Ray Burst showing a significant emission above 20 MeV after EGRET, and the first ever associated with an afterglow, measured at X-rays and in the IR/Optical/UV Significant upper limits are derived for the other GRBs. In this paper we report about the status and the scientific performances of the AGILE instrumentation in the study of GRBs and we discuss the properties of GRB 080514B in the context of the long Gamma Ray Bursts.

<b>First AGILE catalog of high-confidence gamma-ray sources
</b><br>

<br>
ABSTRACT: We present the first catalog of high-confidence-ray sources detected by the AGILE satellite during observations performed from July 9, 2007 to June 30, 2008. Cataloged sources were detected by merging all the available data over the entire time period. AGILE, launched in April 2007, is an ASI mission devoted to-ray observations in the 30 MeV-50 GeV energy range, with simultaneous X-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 keV band. This catalog is based on Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) data for energies greater than 100 MeV. For the first AGILE catalog, we adopted a conservative analysis, with a high-quality event filter optimized to select-ray events within the central zone of the instrument field of view (radius of 40). This is a significance-limited (4) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limited sample due to the non-uniform first-year AGILE sky coverage. The catalog includes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidate pulsars, 13 with blazars (7 FSRQ, 4 BL Lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with HMXRBs, 2 with SNRs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, and 8 with unidentified sources.

ABSTRACT: Context. AGILE is an Italian Space Agency mission dedicated to observing the gamma-ray Universe. The AGILE'S very innovative instrumentation for the first time combines a gamma-ray imager (sensitive in the energy range 30 MeV-50 GeV), a hard X-ray imager (sensitive in the range 18-60 keV), a calorimeter (sensitive in the range 350 keV-100 MeV), and an anticoincidence system.. AGILE was successfully launched on 2007 April 23 from the Indian base of Sriharikota and was inserted in an equatorial orbit with very low particle background. Aims. AGILE provides crucial data for the study of active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, pulsars, unidentified gamma-ray sources, galactic compact objects, supernova remnants, TeV sources, and fundamental physics by microsecond timing. Methods. An optimal sky angular positioning (reaching 0.1 degrees in gamma-rays and 1-2 arcmin in hard X-rays) and very large fields of view (2.5 sr and 1 sr, respectively) are obtained by the use of Silicon detectors integrated in a very compact instrument. Results. AGILE surveyed the gamma-ray sky and detected many Galactic and extragalactic sources during the first months of observations. Particular emphasis is given to multifrequency observation programs of extragalactic and galactic objects. Conclusions. AGILE is a successful high-energy gamma-ray mission that reached its nominal scientific performance. The AGILE Cycle-1 pointing program started on 2007 December 1, and is open to the international community through a Guest Observer Program. (C) ESO 2009.

<b>The Mini-Calorimeter on-board AGILE: The first year in space
</b><br>
(2009) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 160, art. no. 012040, . 
<br>
ABSTRACT: AGILE, the Italian space mission dedicated to gamma-ray and hard-X astrophysics, was successfully launched on 23rd April 2007 and is currently fully operative. The Mini-Calorimeter (MCAL) on-board the AGILE satellite is a scintillation detector made of 20 kg of segmented CsI(Tl) scintillator with photodiode readout with a total geometrical area of 1400 cm 2. MCAL can work both as a slave of the AGILE Silicon tracker and as an independent detector for gamma-ray bursts (GRB) detection in the 300 keV - 100 MeV energy range. Despite its limited thickness, due to weight constraints, MCAL has proven to successfully self-trigger GRBs at MeV energies providing photon-by-photon data with less than 2 μs time resolution and almost all-sky detection capabilities. The instrument design and characteristics, as well as the in-flight performance after one year of operation in space and the scientific results obtained so far are reviewed and discussed.

ABSTRACT: The AGILE Satellite [8] [9], launched the 23rd April 2007, is an Italian mission devoted to high energy gamma-ray astrophysics in the 30 MeV - 50 GeV range, with a window in the hard-X domain 18-60 keV. One of the on-board detectors, the Mini-Calorimeter (MC AL), was also designed to work as all sky transient monitor in the energy range 0.33-100 MeV. Though the main purpose of MCAL is the detection of cosmological Gamma-Ray-Bursts (GRB), MCAL detected transient events with a very brief duration, few msec, that does not match timing and spectral features of known cosmic GRB. These events more likely agree with the features of typical Terrestrial Gamma- Ray Flashes as described in the literature and previously detected by the BATSE instrument onboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory and the RHESSl satellite. The characteristics of the detected TGF candidate events, as well as their geographical distribution will be presented and discussed. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

ABSTRACT: We present the results of extensive observations by the gamma-ray AGILE satellite of the Galactic region hosting the Carina nebula and the remarkable colliding wind binary Eta Carinae (η Car) during the period 2007 July-2009 January. We detect a gamma-ray source (1AGL J1043-5931) consistent with the position of η Car. If 1AGL J1043-5931 is associated with the Car system, our data provide the long sought first detection above 100 MeV of a colliding wind binary. The average gamma-ray flux above 100 MeV and integrated over the preperiastron period 2007 July-2008 October is Fγ = (37 ± 5) × 10-8 ph cm-2 s-1 corresponding to an average gamma-ray luminosity of Lγ = 3.4 × 1034 erg s-1 for a distance of 2.3 kpc. We also report a two-day gamma-ray flaring episode of 1AGL J1043-5931 on 2008 October 11-13 possibly related to a transient acceleration and radiation episode of the strongly variable shock in the system.

<b>Multiwavelength observations of 3C 454.3. I. the agile 2007 november campaign on the "crazy diamond"

ABSTRACT: We report on a multiwavelength observation of the blazar 3C 454.3 (which we dubbed crazy diamond) carried out on November 2007 by means of the astrophysical satellites AGILE, International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), Swift, the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) Consortium, and the optical-NIR telescope Rapid Eye Mount (REM). Thanks to the wide field of view of the AGILE satellite and its prompt alert dissemination to other observatories, we obtained a long (three weeks), almost continuous γ-ray coverage of the blazar 3C 454.3 across 14 decades of energy. This broadband monitoring allows us to study in great detail light curves, correlations, time lags, and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) during different physical states. Gamma-ray data were collected during an AGILE pointing toward the Cygnus Region. Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations were performed to follow up the γ-ray observations in the soft and hard X-ray energy bands. Optical data were acquired continuously by means of a preplanned WEBT campaign and through an REM ToO repointing. 3C 454.3 is detected at a ∼19σ level during the three-week observing period, with an average flux above 100 MeV of F E &gt; 100 MeV = (170 ± 13) × 10-8 photons cm-2 s-1. The γ-ray spectrum can be fitted with a single power law with photon index ΓGRID = 1.73 ± 0.16 between 100 MeV and 1 GeV. We detect significant day-by-day variability of the γ-ray emission during our observations, and we can exclude that the fluxes are constant at the 99.6% (∼2.9σ) level. The source was detected typically around 40 deg off-axis, and it was substantially off-axis in the field of view of the AGILE hard X-ray imager. However, a five-day long ToO observation by INTEGRAL detected 3C 454.3 at an average flux of about F 20-200 keV = 1.49 × 10-3 photons cm-2 s-1with an average photon index of ΓIBIS = 1.75 ± 0.24 between 20-200 keV. Swift also detected 3C 454.3 with a flux in the 0.3-10 keV energy band in the range (1.23-1.40) × 10-2 photons cm-2 s-1 and a photon index in the range ΓXRT = 1.56-1.73. In the optical band, both WEBT and REM show an extremely variable behavior in the R band. A correlation analysis based on the entire data set is consistent with no time lags between the γ-ray and the optical flux variations. Our simultaneous multifrequency observations strongly indicate that the dominant emission mechanism between 30 MeV and 30 GeV is dominated by inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons in the jet on the external photons from the broad line region.

ABSTRACT: During the first year of observations, AGILE detected several blazars at high significance: 3C 279, 3C 454.3, PKS 1510-089, S5 07164-714, 3C 273, MKN 421, and W Comae. We obtained long-term coverage of the Crazy Diamond 3C 454.3, for more than 100 days at energies above 100 MeV. 3C 273 was the first blazar detected simultaneously by the AGILE gamma-ray imaging detector and by its hard X-ray monitor. S5 07164-714, an intermediate BL Lac object, exhibited a very fast and intense gamma-ray transient event during an optical high-state phase, while MKN 421 and W Comae where detected during an AGILE target of opportunity (ToO) repointing. Thanks to the rapid dissemination of our alerts, we were able to obtain multi-wavelength ToO data from other observatories such as Spitzer, Swift, INTEGRAL, RXTE, Suzaku, MAGIC, VERITAS, as well as optical coverage by means of the WEBT Consortium and REM.

ABSTRACT: We present optical, X-ray, high-energy (30 GeV) and very high energy (100 GeV; VHE) observations of the high-frequency peaked blazar Mrk 421 taken between 2008 May 24 and June 23. A high-energy γ-ray signal was detected by AGILE with between June 9 and 15, with F(E&gt;100 MeV) = 42+14 -12 × 10-8 photons cm-2 s-1. This flaring state is brighter than the average flux observed by EGRET by a factor of 3, but still consistent with the highest EGRET flux. In hard X-rays (20-60 keV) SuperAGILE resolved a five-day flare (June 9-15) peaking at 55 mCrab. SuperAGILE, RXTE/ASM and Swift/BAT data show a correlated flaring structure between soft and hard X-rays. Hints of the same flaring behavior are also detected in the simultaneous optical data provided by the GASP-WEBT. A Swift/XRT observation near the flaring maximum revealed the highest 2-10 keV flux ever observed from this source, of 2.6 × 10-9 erg cm -2 s-1 (i.e. &gt;100 mCrab). A peak synchrotron energy of 3 keV was derived, higher than typical values of 0.5-1 keV. VHE observations with MAGIC and VERITAS between June 6 and 8 showed the flux peaking in a bright state, well correlated with the X-rays. This extraordinary set of simultaneous data, covering a 12-decade spectral range, allowed for a deep analysis of the spectral energy distribution as well as of correlated light curves. The γ-ray flare can be interpreted within the framework of the synchrotron self-Compton model in terms of a rapid acceleration of leptons in the jet. (C) 2009. The American Astronomical Society.

<b>Discovery of new gamma-ray pulsars with agile

<br>
ABSTRACT: Using gamma-ray data collected by the Astro-rivelatore Gamma ad Immagini LEggero (AGILE) satellite over a period of almost one year (from 2007 July to 2008 June), we searched for pulsed signals from 35 potentially interesting radio pulsars, ordered according to and for which contemporary or recent radio data were available. AGILE detected three new top-ranking nearby and Vela-like pulsars with good confidence both through timing and spatial analysis. Among the newcomers we find pulsars with very high rotational energy losses, such as the remarkable PSRB1509 - 58 with a magnetic field in excess of 1013 Gauss, and PSRJ2229 + 6114 providing a reliable identification for the previously unidentified EGRET source 3EG2227 + 6122. Moreover, the powerful millisecond pulsar B1821 - 24, in the globular cluster M28, is detected during a fraction of the observations. Four other promising gamma-ray pulsar candidates, among which is the notable J2043 + 2740 with an age in excess of 1 million years, show a possible detection in the timing analysis only and deserve confirmation.

ABSTRACT: Astro-rivelatore Gamma ad Immagini LEggero (AGILE) is a small gamma-ray astronomy satellite mission of the Italian Space Agency dedicated to high-energy astrophysics launched in 2007 April. Its ∼ 1 μs absolute time tagging capability coupled with a good sensitivity in the 30 MeV-30 GeV range, with simultaneous X-ray monitoring in the 18-60 keV band, makes it perfectly suited for the study of gamma-ray pulsars following up on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory/EGRET heritage. In this paper, we present the first AGILE timing results on the known gamma-ray pulsars Vela, Crab, Geminga, and B1706-44. The data were collected from 2007 July to 2008 April, exploiting the mission Science Verification Phase, the Instrument Timing Calibration, and the early Observing Pointing Program. Thanks to its large field of view, AGILE collected a large number of gamma-ray photons from these pulsars (∼ 10,000 pulsed counts for Vela) in only few months of observations. The coupling of AGILE timing capabilities, simultaneous radio/X-ray monitoring, and new tools aimed at precise photon phasing, also exploiting timing noise correction, unveiled new interesting features at the submillisecond level in the pulsars' high-energy light curves.

<b>AGILE observation of a gamma-ray flare from the blazar 3C 279

ABSTRACT: Context. We report the detection by the AGILE satellite of an intense gamma-ray flare from the gamma-ray source 3EG J1255-0549, associated with the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar 3C 279, during the AGILE pointings towards the Virgo Region on 2007 July 9-13. Aims. The simultaneous optical, X-ray and gamma-ray covering allows us to study the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the theoretical models relative to the mid-July flaring episode. Methods. AGILE observed the source during its Science Performance Verification Phase with its two co-aligned imagers: the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) and the hard X-ray imager (Super-AGILE) sensitive in the 30 MeV-50 GeV and 18-60 keV respectively. During the AGILE observation the source was monitored simultaneously in the optical band by the REM telescope and in the X-ray band by the Swift satellite through 4 target of opportunity observations. Results. During 2007 July 9-13, AGILE-GRID detected gamma-ray emission from 3C 279, with the source at ∼2° from the center of the field of view, with an average flux of (2.10 ± 38) × 10 -8 ph cm -2 s -1 for energy above 100 MeV. No emission was detected, by Super-AGILE, with a 3-σ upper limit of 10 mCrab. During the observation, which lasted about 4 days, no significative gamma-ray flux variation was observed. Conclusions. The Spectral Energy Distribution is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone Synchrotron Self Compton emission plus the contributions by external Compton scattering of the direct disk radiation and, to a lesser extent, by external Compton scattering of photons from the Broad Line Region.

ABSTRACT: AGILE is a small space mission of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) devoted to gamma-ray and hard-X astrophysics, successfully launched on April 23, 2007. The AGILE Payload is composed of three instruments: a gamma-ray imager based on a tungsten-silicon tracker (ST), for observations in the gamma ray energy range 30 MeV-50 GeV, a Silicon based X-ray detector, SuperAGILE (SA), for imaging in the range 18-60 keV and a CsI(Tl) Mini-Calorimeter (MCAL) that detects gamma rays or charged particles energy loss in the range 300 keV-100 MeV. MCAL is composed of 30 CsI(Tl) scintillator bars with photodiode readout at both ends, arranged in two orthogonal layers. MCAL can work both as a slave of the ST and as an independent gamma-ray detector for transients and gamma-ray bursts detection. In this paper a detailed description of MCAL is presented together with its performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<b>High energy variability of 3C 273 during the AGILE multiwavelength campaign of December 2007-January 2008

ABSTRACT: Context. We report the results of a 3-week multi-wavelength campaign targeting the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 273 carried out with the AGILE gamma-ray mission, covering the 30 MeV-50 GeV and 18-60 keV, the REM observatory (covering the near-IR and optical), Swift (nearUV/Optical, 0.2-10 keV and 15-50 keV), INTEGRAL (3-200 keV) and Rossi XTE (2-12 keV). This is the first observational campaign including gamma-ray data, after the last EGRET observations, more than 8 years ago. Aims. This campaign has been organized by the AGILE team with the aim of observing, studying and modelling the broad band energy spectrum of the source, and its variability on a week timescale, testing the emission models describing the spectral energy distribution of this source. Methods. Our study was carried out using simultaneous light curves of the source flux from all the involved instruments, in the different energy ranges, to search for correlated variability. Then a time-resolved spectral energy distribution was used for a detailed physical modelling of the emission mechanisms. Results. The source was detected in gamma-rays only in the second week of our campaign, with a flux comparable to the level detected by EGRET in June 1991. We found an indication of a possible anti-correlation between the emission at gamma-rays and at soft and hard X-rays, supported by the complete set of instruments. Instead, optical data do not show short term variability, as expected for this source. Only in two preceding EGRET observations (in 1993 and 1997) 3C 273 showed intra-observation variability in gamma-rays. In the 1997 observation, flux variation in gamma-rays was associated with a synchrotron flare. The energy-density spectrum with almost simultaneous data partially covers the regions of synchrotron emission, the big blue bump, and the inverse-Compton. We adopted a leptonic model to explain the hard X/gamma-ray emissions, although from our analysis hadronic models cannot be ruled out. In the adopted model, the soft X-ray emission is consistent with combined synchrotron-self Compton and external Compton mechanisms, while hard X and gamma-ray emissions are compatible with external Compton from thermal photons of the disk. Under this model, the time evolution of the spectral energy distribution is well interpreted and modelled in terms of an acceleration episode of the electron population, leading to a shift in the inverse Compton peak towards higher energies.

ABSTRACT: AGILE is an Italian Space Agency (ASI) satellite dedicated to high energy Astrophysics. It was launched successfully on 23 April 2007, and it has been operated by the AGILE Ground Segment, consisting of the Ground Station located in Malindi (Kenia), the Mission Operations Centre (MOC) and the AGILE Data Centre (ADC) established in Italy, at Telespazio in Fucino and at the ASI Science Data Centre (ASDC) in Frascati respectively. Due to the low equatorial orbit at ~ 530 Km. with inclination angle of ~ 2.5°, the satellite passes over the Ground Station every ~ 100'. During the visibility period of. ~ 12', the Telemetry (TM) is down linked through two separated virtual channels, VC0 and VC1. The former is devoted to the real time TM generated during the pass at the average rate of 50 Kbit/s and is directly relayed to the Control Centre. The latter is used to downlink TM data collected on the satellite on-board mass memory during the non visibility period. This generates at the Ground Station a raw TM file of up to 37 MByte. Within 20' after the end of the contact, both the real time and mass memory TM arrive at ADC through the dedicated VPN ASINet. Here they are automatically detected and ingested by the TMPPS pipeline in less than 5 minutes. The TMPPS archives each TM file and sorts its packets into one stream for each of the different TM layout. Each stream is processed in parallel in order to unpack the various telemetry field and archive them into suitable FITS files. Each operation is tracked into a MySQL data base which interfaces the TMPPS pipeline to the rest of the scientific pipeline running at ADC. In this paper the architecture and the performance of the TMPPS will be described and discussed.

ABSTRACT: AGILE is an ASI (Italian Space Agency) Small Scientific Mission dedicated to high-energy astrophysics which was launched on April 23 2007 from Satish Dawan Space Centre (India) on a PSLV-C8 rocket. The AGILE Payload is composed of three instruments: a Tungsten-Silicon Tracker designed to detect and image photons in the 30 MeV-50 GeV energy band, an X-ray imager called SuperAGILE that works in the 18-60 keV energy band, and a Minicalorimeter that detects gamma-rays or particle energy deposits between 300~keV and 200~MeV. The instrument is surrounded by an anti-coincidence (AC) system. We have developed a set of Quick Look software tools in the framework of the Test Equipment (TE) and the Electrical Ground Support Equipment (EGSE. This s/w is required in order to support all the assembly, integration and verification (AIV) activities to be carried out for the AGILE mission, from data handling unit level to payload integrated level, calibration campaign, launch campaign and in-orbit commissioning. These software tools have enabled us to test the engineering performance and to perform a health check of the Payload during the various phases. We have used an incremental development approach and a common framework to rapidly adapt our software to the different requirements of the various phases.

ABSTRACT: The Minicalorimeter (MCAL) is a scintillation detector onboard the Italian space mission AGILE, dedicated to gamma-ray and hard-X astrophysics and launched on 23 April, 2007. MCAL can work both as part of the gamma-ray imaging system and as an independent detector for gamma-ray burst (GRB) in the 350 keV - 100 MeV energy range. The on-board trigger logic is now enabled for burst search on timescales as short as 64 ms, leading to a detection rate of about one event/week. MCAL is particularly suitable for the detection of short-hard bursts and contributes to GRB localization through the Inter-Planetary Network (IPN).

<b>The mini-calorimeter on-board AGILE: 18 months in orbit

<br>
ABSTRACT: AGILE, the Italian space mission dedicated to gamma-ray and hard-X astrophysics, was succesfully launched on 23 April 2007 and is currently fully operative. AGILE is placed in an equatorial Low-Earth Orbit, at 550 km altitude with 2.46 degrees inclination. The Mini-Calorimeter (MCAL) on-board AGILE is a scintillation detector made of 30 CsI(TI) bars with photodiode readout at both ends, arranged in two orthogonal layers, for a total amount of 20 kg of active material, an on-axis geometrical area of 1400 cm 2 and a thickness of 1.5 radiation lengths. MCAL can work both as a slave of the AGILE Silicon tracker and as an independent detector for gamma-ray burst (GRB) detection in the 300 keV - 200 MeV energy range. If a trigger is issued by a dedicated onboard logic, data are dowloaded in photon-by-photon mode with a time resolution of 2μs allowing complete spectral and timing analysis of the event, limited by counting statistics only. Moreover, 11 band energy spectra with 1 second time resolution (scientif c ratemeters) are continuously integrated on-board and sent to telemetry for background monitoring. MCAL is currently one of the three detectors in space with microsecond timing accuracy in the MeV range, with a detection rate of 1 GRB/week. The performance of the instrument after 18 months of in orbit operations will be discussed, as well as the scientific results achieved. (C)2008 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: We report the first blazar detection by AGILE. AGILE detected 3C 454.3 during a period of strongly enhanced optical emission in 2007 July. AGILE observed the source with a dedicated repointing during the period 2007 July 24-30 with its two co-aligned imagers, the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector and the hard X-ray imager SuperAGILE sensitive in the 30 MeV to 50 GeV and 18-60 keV ranges, respectively. Over the entire period, AGILE detected γ-ray emission from 3C 454.3 at a significance level of 13.8 σ with an average flux (E&gt; 100 MeV) of (280 ± 40) x 10 -8 photons cm -2 s -1. The γ-ray flux appears to be variable toward the end of the observation. No emission was detected by Super-AGILE in the energy range 20-60 keV, with a 3 σ upper limit of 2.3 x 10 -3 photons cm -2 s -1. The γ-ray flux level of 3C 454.3 detected by AGILE is the highest ever detected for this quasar and among the most intense γ-ray fluxes ever detected from flat-spectrum radio quasars. (C) 2008.

ABSTRACT: The other Authors are with INAF Department in Roma and Milan or with Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) department in Trieste, Como, Roma, Pavia or with Ente Nazionale Energie Alternative (ENEA) department in Roma, Bologna or with Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI). AGILE, an Italian Space Agency (ASI) mission dedicated to the exploration of the gamma-ray Universe, was successfully launched on April 23, 2007 from the Indian base of Sriharikota in an low-particle background equatorial orbit at 550 km height. AGILE gamma ray range cover the 30 MeV - 50 GeV band with its detectors combined together in the GammaRay Imaging Detector (GRID). An X-ray imager (SuperAGILE) operates in the 18 - 60 keV band. Some of the payload instruments are also operated to detect transient X and gamma events with the maln target being the Gamma Ray Burst in the SuperAGILE band and above 300 keV. The GRID instrument consists of a Silicon-Tungsten Tracker, a Caesium Iodide MiniCalorimeter (MCAL), and a plastic-scintillator nticoincidence system (ACS). The GRID achieves an angular resolution of about 15' for bright sources with an unprecedented large fieldof- view about 2.5 sr with a time resolution of few microsec and a very reduced dead-time (less than 200 microsec for a gamma detection). The hard X-ray imager (SuperAGILE) combines a tungsten coded mask with Si detector with a technology identical to the Si-Tracker. It is on top of the gamma-ray detector and has an optimal angular resolution (about 6 arcmin) with good sensitivity over about 1 sr field of view (10-15 mCrab on axis for a I-day integration). The burst monitoring combines the data from SuperAGILE and from MCAL which operates independently with a specific operative mode from 300 keV up to several tens of MeV. All the detector operations are mastered by the Payload Data Handling Unit (PDHU) that includes several operation for data selection and background rejection (C)2008 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: AGILE is a Small Scientific Mission dedicated to high-energy astrophysics supported by the Italian Space Agency. AGILE was successfully launched on April 23, 2007 from the Indian base of Sriharikota and was inserted in an optimal lowparticle background equatorial orbit. The AGILE instrument, highly innovative and designed to detect and image photons in the 30MeV-50GeV and 18-60keV energy bands, is composed by four scientific detectors: a Tungsten-Silicon Tracker, a CsI MiniCalorimeter, a Silicon based X-ray imager and an anticoincidence system for particle background rejection. Moreover, the Payload is completed by a Power Supply Unit (PSU) and a Payload Data Handling Unit (PDHU) and by three ancillary sub-systems (a GPS receiver and two Star Sensors). The PDUU is in charge of the Payload sub-systems control, the operational modes management, the Telemetry and Telecommands management and is optimized for fast on-board processing of the scientific data. The scientific data processing involves a complex and flexible gamma-ray photons filtering, the X-ray photon-by-photon data acquisition and a Burst acquisition logic able to detect the transients on different timescales and perform an on-board Burst coordinates determination. The HW and SW design and implementation were carried out by Thales Alenia Space ltaUa - Milano.

<b>First GRB detections with the AGILE Minicalorimeter
</b><br>
(2008) AIP Conference Proceedings, 1000, pp. 531-534. Cited 1 time.
<br>
ABSTRACT: The Minicalorimeter (MCAL) onboard the AGILE satellite is a 1400cm 2 scintillation detector sensitive in the energy range 0.3-200 MeV. MCAL works both as a slave of the AGILE Silicon Tracker and as an autonomous detector for transient events (BURST mode). A dedicated onboard Burst Search logic scans BURST mode data in search of count rate increase. Peculiar characteristics of the detector are the high energy spectral coverage and a timing resolution of about 2 microseconds. Even if a trigger is not issued, BURST mode data are used to build a broad band energy spectrum (scientific ratemeters) organized in 11 bands for each of the two MCAL detection planes, with a time resolution of 1 second. After the first engineering commissioning phase, following the AGILE launch on 23rd April 2007, between 22 nd June and 5th November 2007 eighteen GRBs were detected offline in the scientific ratemeters data, with a detection rate of about one per week. In this paper the capabilities of the detector will be described and an overview of the first detected GRBs will be given. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics.

ABSTRACT: AGILE is an ASI (Italian Space Agency) Small Space Mission for high energy astrophysics in the range 30 MeV - 50 GeV successfully launched on 23 April 2007 and currently fully operative. The on-ground Gamma Ray calibration of the Payload have been carried out 18 months before launch at the Beam Test Facility - INFN LNF (Roma) using a complement of mechanical and electrical equipment and computer systems specifically developed to that purpose. In particular, a specific software has been designed and developed to automate the operations of the Mechanical Ground Support Equipment (MGSE) which positions the Payload in front of the Beam. In this paper the architecture and the performance of the software will be described and discussed.

<b>Agile and the gamma-ray bursts
</b><br>
(2008) AIP Conference Proceedings, 1000, pp. 523-530. 
<br>
ABSTRACT: AGILE is an ASI high-energy astrophysics mission dedicated to the observation of the Universe. The satellite was successfully launched on April 23, 2007 to a quasi equatorial low-background orbit. The AGILE instrument is very compact and light (∼100kg): a gamma-ray imager (sensitive in the energy band 30 MeV-50 GeV) is the central part of the instrument that includes also a light hard X-ray imager (18-60 keV) positioned on top of the instrument, and an omnidirectional Calorimeter (350 keV-100 MeV). AGILE is aimed at the study of the most energetic phenomena of our Universe including AGNs, GRBs, Galactic sources and transients. For the first time in gamma-ray astrophysics, AGILE reaches a field of view of about 3 sr with excellent angular resolution and good sensitivity. The unique combination of a hard X-ray imager and a gamma-ray imager is ideal for GRB and transient studies that constitute a crucial part of the AGILE scientific program. We summarize here the main characteristics of the GRB broad-band detection system on board of the AGILE satellite and report on some early GRB detections. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics.

<b>AGILE detection of delayed gamma-ray emission from GRB 080514B
</b><br>
(2008) Astronomy and Astrophysics, 491 (2), pp. L25-L28. Cited 43 times.
<br>
ABSTRACT: GRB 080514B is the first gamma ray burst (GRB), since the time of EGRET, for which individual photons of energy above several tens of MeV have been detected with a pair-conversion tracker telescope. This burst was discovered with the Italian AGILE gamma-ray satellite. The GRB was localized by a cooperation between AGILE and the interplanetary network (IPN). The gamma-ray imager (GRID) estimate of the position, obtained before the SuperAGILE-IPN localization, is found to be consistent with the burst position. The hard X-ray emission observed by SuperAGILE lasted about 7 s, while there is evidence that the emission above 30 MeV extends for a longer duration (at least 13 s). Similar behavior has been seen from a few other GRBs observed with EGRET. However, during the brightest phases, the latter measurements were affected by instrumental dead time effects, resulting in only lower limits to the burst intensity. Thanks to the small dead time of the AGILE/GRID we could assess that in the case of GRB 080514B the gamma-ray to X-ray flux ratio changes significantly between the prompt and extended emission phase.

<b>Gamma-ray burst detection with the AGILE mini-calorimeter
</b><br>
(2008) Astronomy and Astrophysics, 490 (3), pp. 1151-1156. Cited 12 times.
<br>
ABSTRACT: Context. The mini-calorimeter (MCAL) instrument on-board the AGILE satellite is a non-imaging gamma-ray scintillation detector sensitive in the 300 keV-100 MeV energy range with a total on-axis geometrical area of 1400 cm. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the main scientific targets of the AGILE mission and the MCAL design as an independent self-triggering detector makes it a valuable all-sky monitor for GRBs. Furthermore MCAL is one of the very few operative instruments with microsecond timing capabilities in the MeV range.Aims. In this paper the results of GRB detections with MCAL after one year of operation in space are presented and discussed.Methods. A flexible trigger logic implemented in the AGILE payload data-handling unit allows the on-board detection of GRBs. For triggered events, energy and timing information are sent to telemetry on a photon-by-photon basis, so that energy and time binning are limited by counting statistics only. When the trigger logic is not active, GRBs can be detected offline in ratemeter data, although with worse energy and time resolution.Results. Between the end of June 2007 and June 2008 MCAL detected 51 GRBs, with a detection rate of about 1 GRB/week, plus several other events at a few milliseconds timescales. Since February 2008 the on-board trigger logic has been fully active. Comparison of MCAL detected events and data provided by other space instruments confirms the sensitivity and effective area estimations. MCAL also joined the 3rd Inter-Planetary Network, to contribute to GRB localization by means of triangulation. (C) 2008 ESO.

<b>AGILE detection of intense gamma-ray emission from the blazar PKS 1510-089
</b><br>
(2008) Astronomy and Astrophysics, 491 (2), pp. L21-L24. Cited 18 times.
<br>
ABSTRACT: Context. We report the detection by the AGILE (Astro-rivelatore Gamma a Immagini LEggero) satellite of an intense gamma-ray flare from the source AGL J1511-0909, associated with the powerful quasar PKS 1510-089, during ten days of observations from 23 August to 1 September 2007.Aims. During the observation period, the source was in optical decrease following a flaring event monitored by the GLAST-AGILE Support Program (GASP) of the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT). The simultaneous gamma-ray, optical, and radio coverage allows us to study the spectral energy distribution and the theoretical models based on the synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) emission mechanisms.Methods. AGILE observed the source with its two co-aligned imagers, the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector and the hard X-ray imager Super-AGILE sensitive in the 30 MeV / 50 GeV and 18 / 60 keV bands, respectively.Results. Between 23 and 27 August 2007, AGILE detected gamma-ray emission from PKS 1510-089 when this source was located ∼50° off-axis, with an average flux of (270 ± 65) × 10-8 photons cm-2 s-1 for photon energy above 100 MeV. In the following period, 28 August-1 September, after a satellite re-pointing, AGILE detected the source at ∼35° off-axis, with an average flux (E &gt; 100 MeV) of (195 ± 30) × 10-8 photons cm-2 s -1. No emission was detected by Super-AGILE, with a 3-σ upper limit of 45 mCrab in 200 ks.Conclusions. The spectral energy distribution is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self Compton (SSC) emission plus contributions by external photons: the SSC emission contributes primarily to the X-ray band, whereas the contribution of the IC from the external disc and the broad line region match the hard gamma-ray spectrum observed.

<b>AGILE detection of variable γ-ray activity from the blazar S5 0716+714 in September-October 2007
</b><br>
(2008) Astronomy and Astrophysics, 489 (3), pp. L37-L40. Cited 25 times.
<br>
ABSTRACT: Aims. We report the γ-ray activity from the intermediate BL Lac S5 0716+714 during observations acquired by the AGILE satellite in September and October 2007. These detections of activity were contemporaneous with a period of intense optical activity, which was monitored by GASP-WEBT. This simultaneous optical and γ-ray coverage allows us to study in detail the light curves, time lags, γ-ray photon spectrum, and Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) during different states of activity.Methods. AGILE observed the source with its two co-aligned imagers, the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) and the hard X-ray imager (Super-AGILE), which are sensitive to the 30 MeV-50 GeV and 18-60 keV energy ranges, respectively. Observations were completed in two different periods, the first between 2007 September 4-23, and the second between 2007 October 24-November 1.Results. Over the period 2007 September 7-12, AGILE detected γ-ray emission from the source at a significance level of 9.6-σ with an average flux ( &gt; 100 MeV) of (97 15) 10 photons cm -2s -1, which increased by a factor of at least four within three days. No emission was detected by Super-AGILE for the energy range 18-60 keV to a 3-σ upper limit of 10 mCrab in 335 ks. In October 2007, AGILE repointed toward S5 0716+714 following an intense optical flare, measuring an average flux of (47 11) 10 photons cm -2s -1 at a significance level of 6.0-σ. Conclusions. The γ-ray flux of S5 0716+714 detected by AGILE is the highest ever detected for this blazar and one of the most intense γ-ray fluxes detected from a BL Lac object. The SED of mid-September appears to be consistent with the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission model, but only by including two SSC components of different variabilities. (C) 2008 ESO.

<b>Long-term AGILE monitoring of the puzzling gamma-ray source 3EG J1835+5918
</b><br>

<br>
ABSTRACT: Context. We present the AGILE gamma-ray observations of the field containing the puzzling gamma-ray source 3EG J1835+5918. This source is one of the most remarkable unidentified EGRET sources.Aims. An unprecedentedly long AGILE monitoring of this source yields important information on the positional error box, flux evolution, and spectrum.Methods. 3EG J1835+5918 has been in the AGILE field of view several times in 2007 and 2008 for a total observing time of 138 days from 2007 Sep. 04 to 2008 June 30 encompassing several weeks of continuous coverage.Results. With an exposure time approximately twice that of EGRET, AGILE confirms the existence of a prominent gamma-ray source (AGL J1836+5926) at a position consistent with that of EGRET, although with a remarkably lower average flux value for photon energies greater than 100 MeV. A 5-day bin temporal analysis of the whole data set of AGL J1836+5926 shows some evidence for variability of the gamma-ray flux. The source spectrum between 100 MeV and 1 GeV can be fitted with a power law with photon index in the range 1.6-1.7, fully consistent with the EGRET value.Conclusions. The faint X-ray source RX J1836.2+5925 that has been proposed as a possible counterpart of 3EG J1835+5918 is well within the AGILE error box. Future continuous monitoring (both by AGILE and GLAST) is needed to confirm the gamma-ray flux variability and to unveil the source origin, a subject that is currently being pursued through a multiwavelength search for counterparts.

ABSTRACT: We present the results of a series of optical, UV, X-ray and -ray observations of the BL Lac object S50716+714 carried out by the Swift and AGILE satellites in late 2007 when the blazar was flaring close to its historical maximum at optical frequencies. We have found that the optical through soft X-ray emission, likely due to synchrotron radiation, was highly variable and displayed a different behavior in the optical UV and soft X-ray bands. The 4-10 keV flux, most probably dominated by the inverse Compton component, instead remained constant. The counting statistics in the relatively short AGILE GRID observation was low and consistent with a constant -ray flux at a level similar to the maximum observed by EGRET. An estimate of the -ray spectral slope gives a value of the photon index that is close to 2, suggesting that the peak of the inverse Compton component in the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) is within the AGILE energy band. The different variability behavior observed in different parts of the SED exclude interpretations predicting highly correlated flux variability like changes in the beaming factor or the magnetic field in simple SSC scenarios. The observed SED changes may instead be interpreted as due to the sum of two SSC components, one of which is constant while the other is variable and with a systematically higher synchrotron peak energy.

ABSTRACT: AGILE is an Italian Space Agency mission dedicated to the exploration of the gamma-ray Universe. The AGILE, very innovative instrument, combines for the first time a gamma-ray imager (sensitive in the range 30 MeV-50 GeV) and a hard X-ray imager (sensitive in the range 18-60 keV). An optimal angular resolution and very large fields of view are obtained by the use of state-of-the-art Silicon detectors integrated in a very compact instrument. AGILE was successfully launched on April 23, 2007 from the Indian base of Sriharikota and was inserted in an optimal low-particle background equatorial orbit. AGILE will provide crucial data for the study of Active Galactic Nuclei, Gamma-Ray Bursts, unidentified gamma-ray sources, galactic compact objects, supernova remnants, TeV sources, and fundamental physics by microsecond timing. The AGILE Cycle-1 pointing program started on 2007 December 1, and is open to the international community through a Guest Observer Program. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: AGILE, the small scientific mission of the Italian Space Agency devoted to Hard-X and Gamma-ray astrophysics, was successfully launched on April 23, 2007. The AGILE payload is composed of a tungsten-silicon tracker (ST), operating in the gamma-ray energy range 30 MeV-50 GeV; Super-AGILE, an X-ray imager operating in the energy range 15-45 keV; the Minicalorimeter (MCAL) and an Anticoincidence shield. MCAL is a detector of about 1400 cm2 sensitive in the range 0.3-200 MeV, that can be used both as a slave of the ST to contribute to the AGILE Gamma Ray imaging Detector (GRID operative mode) and autonomously for detection of transient events (BURST operative mode). MCAL is made of 30 CsI(Tl) bar-shaped scintillation detectors with photodiode readout at both ends, arranged in two orthogonal layers. Energy and position of interaction can be derived from a proper composition of the signals readout at the bar's ends, absolute time tagging can be achieved with a μ s resolution. The Burst logic deals with various rate-meters on different time scales, energy bands, and MCAL spatial zones. Different algorithms can be chosen for Burst triggering considering also the contribution of other detectors like Super AGILE. In this paper the various trigger logic will be reviewed as well as their on-ground test performed with a dedicated experimental setup. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

<b>GRB 070724B: The first gamma ray burst localized by SuperAGILE and its Swift X-ray afterglow

<br>
ABSTRACT: GRB 070724B is the first gamma ray burst localized by SuperAGILE, the hard X-ray monitor aboard the AGILE satellite. The coordinates of the event were published ∼ h after the trigger. The Swift X-Ray Telescope pointed at the SuperAGILE location and detected the X-ray afterglow inside the SuperAGILE error circle. The AGILE gamma-ray Tracker and Minicalorimeter did not detect any significant gamma ray emission associated with GRB 070724B in the MeV and GeV range, neither prompt nor delayed. Searches for the optical afterglow were performed by the Swift UVOT and the Palomar automated 60-inch telescopes, resulting in no significant detection. Similarly, the Very Large Array did not detect any radio afterglow. This is the first GRB event associated with an X-ray afterglow with a firm upper limit in the 100 MeV-30 GeV energy range.

ABSTRACT: The Italian small satellite mission AGILE has been launched the 23 rd of April 2007. SuperAGILE is the solidstate hard X-ray imager of the mission. It is a coded-mask imager, with six arcmin angular resolution, a field of view in excess of 1 steradian, and a gross energy resolution. Ground calibration campaigns have been performed in the last year to optimize the detector response, for the energy calibration, to obtain the effective area at various angles for various energy bands, to study location accuracy and angular resolution. In this paper we report the preliminary results achieved. The AGILE satellite has just finished the first and larger part of its commissioning phase. SuperAGILE successfully passed the commissioning tests, and it is now in its final configuration. It is observing the X-ray sky since the end of June as a part of the Science Verification Phase. The in-flight calibrations has been started and will ended at the end of October. We show the first data obtained with the instrument in the first months of observations.

Microsecond on-board photon tagging and a ∼ 100 microsecond gamma-ray detection deadtime will be crucial for fast GRB timing. On-board calculated GRB coordinates and energy fluxes will be quickly transmitted to the ground by an ORBCOMM transceiver.

ABSTRACT: AGILE is a small space mission of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) devoted to astrophysics in the gamma-ray energy range 30 MeV - 50 GeV, and in the X-ray band 15 keV - 45 keV. The AGILE Payload is composed of three instruments: a gamma-ray imager based on a Tungsten-Silicon Tracker (ST), for observations in the gamma ray energy range 30 MeV - 50 GeV, a Silicon based X-ray detector, Super-Agile (SA), for imaging in the range 15 keV - 40 keV and a CsI(Tl) Mini-Calorimeter (MCAL) that detects gamma rays or particle energy deposits between 300 keV and 200 MeV. The payload is currently fully integrated and the satellite is expected to be launched in the second half of 2006. MCAL is composed of 30 CsI(Tl) scintillator detectors with the shape of a bar with photodiode readout at both ends, arranged in two orthogonal layers. MCAL can work both as a slave of the ST and as an independent gamma-ray detector for the detection of transients and Gamma Ray Bursts. In this paper a detailed description of MCAL is presented together with the first on ground calibration results.

ABSTRACT: AGILE is an ASI space mission for high energy astrophysics in the gamma ray energy range 30MeV-50GeV, and in the X-ray band (10keV-40keV). AGILE is composed of three detecting systems: a Tungsten-Silicon Tracker, a Csl Mini-Calorimeter and a Silicon based X-ray detector (Super-Agile), plus an anticoincidence system for background rejection. The satellite will have good imaging performances (with angular resolution of a few arc-minutes in the gamma ray band), good timing resolution and a large field of view (about 1/5 of the sky). AGILE high energy detector is composed of a Silicon Tracker, a Mini-Calorimeter, the Anticoincidence and the Data Handling system The Mini-Calorimeter can also work as a stand-alone gamma ray detector in the energy range 250keV-250MeV, with no imaging capabilities, for the detection of transients and gamma ray burst events and for the evaluation of gamma ray background fluctuations. The Mini-Calorimeter is made of 30 independent elements of 37.5 × 2.3 × 1.5 cm stacked in two layers. Each detector scintillator signal is read out via two photodiodes glued on the small surfaces of the bar. The characteristics of the engineering model detectors has been deeply investigated and will be reported. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: AGILE is an ASI (Italian Space Agency) Small Space Mission for high energy astrophysics in the range 30 MeV - 50 GeV which is planned to be launched in 2005. Mechanical equipments are required for the Assembly, Integration and Verification (AIV) of the various subsystems together, forming the Payload complement. Furthermore, the calibration of the AGILE'S performances requires to test with a beam line and with discrete X and γ ray sources the instrument response as a function of the energy of the incoming photons and particles and of their inclination with respect to the instrument axis. These AIV and Calibration activities lead to require an ad hoc Mechanical Ground Support Equipment (MGSE) which is able to move the instrument up and down, left and right as well as to rotate the instrument around the vertical axes and to tilt it by an angle between 0 and 180° with reference to the direction of the beam. We present here the MGSE we have designed in order to provide these functionalities with the required performances, and taking into account the working environment of the AIV and calibration sites.

ABSTRACT: AGILE is an ASI (Italian Space Agency) Small Space Mission for high energy astrophysics in the range 30 MeV - 50 GeV which is planned to be launched in 2005. The AGILE payload complement consists of a Tungsten-Silicon Tracker, a CsI Minicalorimeter, an anticoincidence system and a X-Ray detector sensitive in the 10-40 KeV range. The Minicalorimeter detector shall contribute to the determination of the energy interacting gamma-rays and will allow the detection of Gamma Ray Burst and other impulsive events from around 300 KeV. The MCAL Science Console software is part of the test equipment which provides support to the integration, verification and calibration of the Minicalorimeter from the Simplified Electrical Model (SEM) to the Protoflight model (PFM). We describe here the software version we have developed for the SEM test equipment, and which has been used during the functional, performance and calibration test campaign carried out in 2003 on the SEM Minicalorimeter model. In particular we address the performance and architectural issues in view of the next release to be procured for the Minicalorimeter PFM.

ABSTRACT: In this paper we describe the instrumentation and the software tools we developed to test the SuperAGILE Front-End Electronics (SAFEE) and Interface Electronics (SAIE). The SAFEE is based on twelve XAA1.2 ASICs (produced by IDE-AS). The Test Equipment hardware is composed of commercial VME modules and laboratory developed boards. Commercial VME boards were used for data acquisition and SAFEE handling. Laboratory developed boards provide signal conditioning, pulse generation, trigger system and timing. The VME based architecture assured a stable system for a period of years and a very high acquisition rate. The choice of 'laboratory-developed' boards allowed an easy and cost effective continuous improvement of the system. Two Linux running PC were used, one for the "System Control" and data acquisition, the other one for data reduction and archiving. The s/w for DAQ, data-reduction, and analysis also was laboratory-developed and based on well-known tools.

ABSTRACT: AGILE is an Italian Space Agency (ASI) space mission for high energy astrophysics in the gamma ray energy range 30MeV-50GeV, and in the X-ray band 10keV-40keV. AGILE is composed of three detecting systems: a Tungsten-Silicon Tracker, a CsI(Tl) Mini-Calorimeter and a Silicon based X-ray detector (Super-Agile), plus an anticoincidence system for background rejection. The satellite will have good imaging performances (with angular resolution of a few arc-minutes in the gamma ray band), good timing resolution and a large field of view (about 1/5 of the sky). AGILE detection principle is based on the pair production process that arises from the interaction of high energy photons with the Tungsten layers of the Silicon Tracker. The Silicon Tracker determines the direction of the incoming radiation, while the Mini-Calorimeter contributes to the evaluation of the interacting photons' energy. The Mini-Calorimeter can also work as a stand-alone gamma ray detector in the energy range 250keV-250MeV, with no imaging capabilities, for the detection of transients and gamma ray burst events (in cooperation with Super-Agile) and for the evaluation of gamma ray background fluctuations. We report the status and the result of the latest tests on the Mini-Calorimeter models already realized.

<b>A position sensitive gamma-ray detector based on silicon drift detectors coupled to scintillators for application in the MEGA compton telescope
</b><br>
(2004) IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record, 1, pp. 171-175. 
<br>
ABSTRACT: An array of gamma-ray detectors based on silicon drift detectors (SDD) coupled to thallium activated cesium iodide (CsI(Tl)) scintillating crystals is presented. Because of SDDs low output capacitance and the possibility to have the first amplifying stage directly integrated on chip, SDDs show better noise performance than traditional p-i-n photodiodes. The array is read out with custom made ASICs built to match with the SDDs electrical properties. Shaped signals are digitally converted by a Digital Front-End Electronic Board which also takes care of ASICs handshaking. The system architecture is based on that of the IBIS/PICsIT instrument onboard the INTEGRAL satellite, at present fully operative. The instrument has been designed as a calorimeter module suitable to work in conjunction with the MEGA Compton telescope prototype, developed at the Max Planck Institut für Extraterrestrische Physik (MPE), Garching, Germany. The calorimeter module will detect photons scattered by the MEGA silicon tracker. The improvements in energy resolution provided by SDD/CsI(Tl) detectors should improve the overall energy and angular resolution of the Compton telescope. The detectors properties and the system performance, from analogue signal conditioning to the digital data handling will be reported and discussed. (C) 2004 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: AGILE, Astrorivelatore Gamma ad Immagini LEggero, is a small space mission of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) devoted to observations for astrophysics in the gamma ray energy range 30MeV-50GeV with a simultaneous window in the X-ray band 15keV-45keV. AGILE Payload is composed by four scientific detectors: a Tungsten-Silicon Tracker, a CsI Mini-Calorimeter, a Silicon based X-ray imager and an anticoincidence system for particle background rejection. Moreover, the Payload is completed by a Power Supply Unit (PSU) and a Payload Data Handling Unit (PDHU) and by three ancillary sub-systems (a GPS receiver and two Star Sensors). The PDHU tasks are: the Payload scientific and ancillary sub-systems control, the operational modes management, the scientific data processing and the Telemetry and Telecommands management. The scientific data processing involves the gamma-ray photons filtering, the X-ray data acquisition and a Burst acquisition logic able to perform an on-board Burst coordinates determination. The HW and SW design and implementation is in charge of the Alenia Spazio S.p.A. - Laben. In this paper we present a general description of the PDHU and the guidelines for the scientific simulations and the HW and SW testing activities. (C) 2004 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: AGILE is a small space mission of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) devoted to observations for astrophysics in the gamma-ray energy range 30 MeV-50 GeV with a simultaneous window in the X-ray band 10keV-40keV. AGILE payload is made of a Tungsten-Silicon Tracker, a CsI Mini-Calorimeter for the high energy band and a Silicon based X-ray detector (Super-Agile); an anticoincidence system carries out background rejection. In the gamma-ray's band the satellite will have a field of view of about 1/5 of the sky, with angular resolution of a few arc-minutes and good timing resolution. For the high energy AGILE detection principle is based on the pair production process that arises from the interaction between photons and the Tungsten layers above the Silicon Tracker. The Silicon Tracker is designed to determine the direction of the incoming radiation, while the Mini-Calorimeter evaluates the energy of the interacting photons and particles. For the detection of transients and gamma-ray burst events, the Mini-Calorimeter will also work as a stand-alone gamma-ray detector, with no imaging capabilities, covering the energy range 250 keV-250 MeV. The Mini-Calorimeter is made of an array of position sensitive CsI(TI) scintillator bars with Photodiode read-out. The characteristics of its detector elements and the front end electronics signal processing allow a moderate position reconstruction of the detected event. In this paper a description of the Mini-Calorimeter is reported as well as a summary of performances reached with the pre-flight instrument models already built and tested. (C) 2004 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: AGILE is an ASI gamma-ray astrophysics space Mission which will operate in the 30 MeV - 50 GeV range with imaging capabilities also in the 10 - 40 keV range. Primary scientific goals include the study of AGNs, gamma-ray bursts, Galactic sources, unidentified gamma-ray sources, diffuse Galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray emission, high-precision timing studies, and Quantum Gravity testing. The AGILE scientific instrument is based on an innovative design of three detecting systems: (1) a Silicon Tracker, (2) a Mini-Calorimeter, and (3) an ultralight coded mask system with Si-detectors (Super-AGILE). AGILE is designed to provide: (1) excellent imaging in the energy bands 30 MeV-50 GeV (5-10 arcmin for intense sources) and 10-40 keV (1-3 arcmin); (2) optimal timing capabilities, with independent readout systems and minimal deadtimes for the Silicon Tracker, Super-AGILE and Mini-Calorimeter; (3) large field of view for the gamma-ray imaging detector (∼3 sr) and Super-AGILE (∼1 sr). AGILE will be the only Mission entirely dedicated to observations above 30 MeV during the period 2004-2006.

ABSTRACT: AGILE is an ASI Small Scientific Mission dedicated to gamma-ray astrophysics, which will detect and image photons in the 30 MeV - 50 GeV and in the 10-40 keV energy ranges. It is planned to be operational in early 2004 and it will be the only Mission entirely dedicated to source detection above 30 MeV during the period 2004-2006. AGILE will be an excellent gamma-ray imager with a spatial resolution of ∼ 40 μm and a very large FOV (∼ 1/5 of the sky). It allows simultaneous observations in the hard X-ray and in the γ-ray bands and it is characterized by an optimal temporal resolution (absolute timing of ∼ 2 μs and deadtimes of ∼ 100 μs for the GRID and of ∼ 5 μs for Super-AGILE and the Mini-Calorimeter). AGILE main scientific objectives will be: Active Galactic Nuclei, Gamma-Ray Bursts, Pulsars, unidentified gamma-ray sources and diffuse Galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray emission. In this paper (Part I) we focus on the AGILE scientific goals, the AGILE instrument and the on-board data processing.
